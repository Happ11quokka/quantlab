US economy downgraded by Goldman Sachs as Trump slump takes hold,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-downgraded-goldman-sachs-060000358.html,"America’s growth forecasts have been slashed amid fears that Donald Trump’s trade war will plunge the global economy into recession.
The US economy is now expected to grow by just 1.7pc this year, according to Goldman Sachs, down from a previous forecast of 2.4pc after the president unleashed a barrage of global tariffs.
The downgrade reflects a growing Wall Street backlash against the Trump administration, as stock markets tumbled on Monday in the wake of the president refusing to rule out a US recession.
The sell-off led to the tech-heavy Nasdaq sinking by as much as 3.9pc, while the S&P 500 fell by 1.5pc.
Morgan Stanley has since predicted that the S&P could drop by a further 5pc in the coming months if the president continues to ramp up his trade war.
Jan Hatzius, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said the bank cut its growth forecasts because Mr Trump’s tariffs were damaging the economy and considerably higher than expected.
“First, they [tariffs] raise consumer prices – and thereby cut real income,” he said.
“Second, tariffs tend to tighten financial conditions. Third, trade policy uncertainty leads firms to delay investment.”
America is now facing a 20pc chance of recession, Goldman Sachs predicts, as economists believe Mr Trump will water down tariffs once the scale of the economic threat becomes clear.
Without changes, JP Morgan warned that the US risks triggering a recession “in all corners of the world”, particularly if Mr Trump launches a trade war against Europe.
When asked about a US recession on Sunday, Mr Trump said: “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big.”
Bruce Kasman, economist at the investment bank, said: “We see a materially higher risk (40pc) of a global recession this year due to extreme US policies.
“As US policies are starting to turn less business-friendly, the risk is that sentiment sours and this leads to a sharper pull-back in spending in all corners of the world.
“Even if a full-blown trade war is averted, the back-and-forth threats could still be sufficient to slow global growth.”
JP Morgan added that Mr Trump’s erratic policy announcements are draining confidence from US businesses, which are also suffering from the stock market volatility.
Analysts at BCA Research described a recession in the US as “imminent” as the country faces “a cascade of bad economic news”.
However, Howard Lutnick, Mr Trump’s commerce secretary, insisted: “There’s going to be no recession in America.”
In an interview to NBC News, he said: “Donald Trump is a winner. He’s going to win for the American people. That’s just the way it’s going to be.
“We’ll unleash America out to the world. Grow our economy in a way we’ve never grown before. You are going to see over the next two years the greatest set of growth coming from America.”
It comes after the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said the US economy is on track to shrink in the first quarter at an annualised rate of 2.4pc, in a stark turnaround from the growth rate of 2.3pc in the final three months of 2024.
Analysts at Capital Economics said the anticipated contraction is in large part the result of importers pulling goods into the US before tariffs make those purchases more expensive, meaning the economy should bounce back in the coming quarter.
However, there are also signs the American consumer is becoming more cautious, said Paul Dales at the consultancy.
He said: “We are not dismissing what appears to be the growing risk that there is a fundamental weakness in the US economy linked to the uncertainty caused by the new policies and tariffs and what that means for inflation. That is not our forecast at the moment, but we are getting a little bit more concerned about it.
“Everywhere else, it depends on their exposure to US tariffs. If the tariffs of 25pc were placed on Canada and Mexico, both would fall into recession.
“For a lot of other countries, like Europe, China and the UK, we do not think they are exposed enough to the US economy and tariffs, so it is more about a headwind for those economies rather than a dramatic game changer which suddenly plunges them into recession.”
Meanwhile, analysts at Policy Exchange warned that Britain must stockpile microchips and medicines in anticipation of potential US tariffs.
Harry Halem and Marcus Solarz Hendriks, co-authors of a new report on UK supply chains, said Britain must start drawing up contingency plans in the event of critical industries being cut off from US imports.
They called on the Government to build stockpiles of basic medicines and semiconductor-related materials to be able to sustain the population for 90 days in the event of a major supply chain crisis.

Trump says he will buy a 'new Tesla' to show support for Musk,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-buy-tesla-show-055020759.html,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will buy a new Tesla car to show support for the electric carmaker's chief and his ally Elon Musk amid recent ""Tesla Takedown"" protests and the slump in the company's stock price.
Musk's role in sweeping cuts to the federal workforce at the behest of Trump has led to protests in the U.S. against Tesla.
About 350 demonstrators protested outside a Tesla electric vehicle dealership in Portland, Oregon, last week, while nine people were arrested during a raucous demonstration outside a New York City Tesla dealership earlier in March.
Musk is spearheading the Trump administration's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump defended Musk by saying he was ""putting it on the line” to help the country and was doing a ""fantastic"" job.
""I'm going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American,"" Trump said.
Musk thanked the president for his support on his own social media platform X.
Tesla's market capitalization has more than halved since hitting an all-time high of $1.5 trillion on December 17, erasing most of the gains the stock made after Musk helped finance the election victory of U.S. President Donald Trump.
The stock's decline since December stems from falling vehicle sales and profits, protests of Musk's political activity and investor worries that politics are distracting the world’s richest man from tending to his cash cow.

Big Chinese Share Sales Are Luring Back Long-Term Investors,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-chinese-share-sales-luring-053530448.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Global long-term investors are placing billions of dollars worth of orders in Chinese deals after years of largely shunning them.

In the past week in Hong Kong, deep-pocketed firms known as “long-only” investors — such as mutual funds — have bought shares in electric-car giant BYD Co. and bubble-tea maker Mixue Group, as well as Baidu Inc. bonds exchangeable into Trip.com Group Ltd. stock, according to people familiar with the matter.
It’s a significant development because the return of such buy-and-hold investors is seen as crucial to lay the foundations for stable and sustainable gains in Chinese stocks. Long-term investors had stayed away from Chinese stocks over the past few years amid a prolonged market slump.
“Long-only investors have a longer investment horizon and are less likely to sell shares immediately after an IPO,” said Andy Wong, IPO leader at advisory firm SW Hong Kong. “Their participation in the market can provide stability to the company’s stock price in relatively volatile capital markets created by short-term investors.”
For now, those funds appear most visible in the biggest deals. They participated in BYD’s recent $5.6 billion share sale, Hong Kong’s biggest one in nearly four years. Baidu’s $2 billion offering of bonds exchangeable to Trip.com shares matched a record for that type of security by an Asian company.
Long-only investors snapped up at least $1.5 billion of BYD’s shares, while in Baidu’s offering, they ordered enough to cover the entire deal, people familiar with the matter said.
“The scale of the transactions is reminiscent of 2021,” said Phyllis Wang, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s head of equity capital markets syndicate for Asia excluding Japan, referring to recent Chinese deals broadly.
The return of long-term investors to these offerings coincides with the rally in Chinese stocks, triggered by DeepSeek’s artificial-intelligence breakthrough, which supercharged investors’ perceptions about Chinese technology companies. The gains added to positive sentiment from Beijing’s economic stimulus measures, which late last year also helped draw global investors back to deals in Hong Kong.
Despite this week’s global selloff, the market watchers continue to be bullish on the outlook for Chinese stocks. Citigroup Inc. just raised its outlook for Chinese stocks to overweight, and the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index is up more than 18% this year.
Goldman Sachs strategists led by Kinger Lau recently noted that global long-only investors have become more engaged in Chinese IPOs and share sales lately, and are increasingly motivated to buy more shares of Chinese companies due to volatility in the US stock market.
Ivy Hu, head of China ECM at UBS Group AG, which helped arrange BYD’s deal, said that offering showed that large investors from the US and Europe have begun returning to Chinese share sales. That’s a contrast to the post-2021 landscape where Asia-based investors were the dominant buyers, she said.
The outlook for Chinese IPOs appears robust, though the pace of deals may pick up after after this month because many companies are in their so-called blackout periods ahead of their earnings releases, Hu said. Bloomberg Intelligence predicts Hong Kong’s IPO market will more than double to $22 billion this year.
Still, the return of global investors appears to be limited to certain Chinese deals. In the broader equities market, mutual funds engaged in active stock picking continued to sell Chinese stocks despite the rally, according to data from Morgan Stanley.
Take Barry Wang, a portfolio manager at Oberweis Asset Management. He said he’s been looking into more deals this year, but they would still need to be priced attractively for him to pick them up.
“Overall sentiment is improving toward China,” Wang said. “But after a strong year-to-date rally, valuation and business fundamentals should be key factors in considering these deals.”

China is ending its annual Congress with questions open over how to revive its slowing economy,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-ending-annual-congress-questions-053307495.html,"BEIJING (AP) — China is wrapping up its biggest political event of the year on Tuesday leaving one question unanswered: How far will it go to try to revive economic growth in 2025?
A recurring theme throughout the weeklong meeting of the nearly 3,000-member National People’s Congress was the need to boost investment and consumer spending.
How much will be done to translate words into action will only become clear in the months ahead as the ruling Communist Party juggles priorities. What is clear is that a trade war with the United States has left the outlook for the coming months uncertain.
At stake is the health of the world's second largest economy, a major exporter of products to countries around the world and an important market for foreign companies from Apple to Volkswagen. A prolonged property crisis has sapped consumer and business confidence, depriving the economy of its past vitality. Now, a tariff war unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump is compounding those problems.
China holds back on major stimulus — for now
The Congress opened with the announcement of an economic growth target of ""about 5%” for this year, a level that analysts said would be difficult to achieve with the measures detailed during this year's Congress.
They include borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving 300 billion yuan ($41.3 billion) in rebates to consumers who trade-in old cars and appliances for new ones. But much of the borrowing will go to supporting the housing market and local governments weighed down by debt.
“It is unclear how much of a jolt this budget will provide to underlying domestic demand and reflation efforts, despite the sizeable rise in the deficit,” Jeremy Zook, the lead China analyst for Fitch Ratings, said in a report.
The ambitious 5% growth target signaled to analysts that more stimulus may be coming. Last year, the government surprised stock markets with various moves beginning in September to push growth up to 5%, also the target in 2024.
Finance Minister Lan Fo’an told journalists covering the Congress that the government had sufficient tools in reserve to deal with external or domestic uncertainties.
Xi seeks private sector help, within limits
Chinese President Xi Jinping seems bent on reinvigorating private businesses, which provide a large share of growth and jobs in the country's state-dominated economy. Years of regulatory crackdowns have shaken the confidence of entrepreneurs and other investors.
The Congress reviewed comments on a law meant to improve the environment for private enterprises by regulating aspects of market access, financing, competition and property rights protection, among others.
Xi aims to send a “message to entrepreneurs, but also to local governments and regulators, that the private sector’s important and it’s necessary,” Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute, said ahead of the congress.
Private companies will also gain access to a higher share of loans than before, and financing for private businesses raised through bond issuance will be expanded, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said in his work report.
The foreign minister says the US shouldn't bully
Much rides on how far Trump pursues his trade wars with China and other countries.
China has diversified its export markets in recent years, but the U.S. remains a vital trading partner. The greater fear is not the tariffs themselves but the health of the U.S. economy and demand for Chinese products, said Alicia Garcia Herrero, the chief Asia-Pacific economist for Natixis investment bank.
Trump has raised tariffs on imports from China twice since taking office in January. China has shown no sign of backing down.
“If the American side goes further down this wrong path, we will fight to the end,” Commerce Minister Wang Wentao told journalists during the Congress.
Asked about Trump’s “America First” policy, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the law of the jungle would reign if all countries adopted a “my country first” approach.
“A big country should honor its international obligations and fulfill its due responsibilities,” he said to journalists at the Congress. “It should not put selfish interests before principles, still less wield its power to bully the weak.”
A Chinese buzzword makes a comeback
The government said in its annual report that it would address what it considers unproductive “rat-race” competition, invoking a term that was a buzzword in China five years ago among stressed-out younger workers.
The government is applying the term “neijuan” — more commonly translated as “involution” — to companies and local governments rather than workers. A proliferation of green energy firms, for example, has led to gluts in solar panels and other equipment and fierce price wars that ultimately harm the industry.
“Their strategies are similar, which leads to extremely cruel competition,” Chinese tech leader Lei Jun, the CEO of Xiaomi and a delegate to the Congress, told state media.
The solutions are unclear, experts say, noting that government subsidies for green energy helped create the problem by encouraging so many start-ups.

Futures attached to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) inched up 0.2%. Futures attached to the benchmark S&P 500 (ES=F) climbed 0.1%. Futures attached to the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (NQ=F) fell 0.1%.
On Monday, the three major indexes built on losses from the previous week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) falling a whopping 4% as ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks faltered.
The mood on Wall Street has grown increasingly foreboding as President Donald Trump presses on with his fast-moving trade war, undeterred by concerns over the health of the US economy. Goldman Sachs became the latest Wall Street firm to slash economic forecasts amid the tariff turmoil.

Delta Airlines (DAL) cut its outlook for the current quarter on Monday, citing ""macro uncertainty,"" in an early read on how a gloomy economic mood could weigh on corporate performance this year. The airline company's shares plunged after-the-bell.
Investors are anticipating a pulse check on the state of inflation later this week, with February's Consumer Price Index (CPI) print due Wednesday and a reading on the Producer Price Index (PPI) set for Thursday.
President Donald Trump has taken a different approach to the stock market during his second term in office.
Namely: he appears to have outsourced the responsibility.
And after a sharp sell-off across the stock market on Monday saw post-election gains across the major indexes and several key tech stocks that have powered the market wiped out, it was not the president, but rather the vice president that appeared to do the talking to investors.
In a post on X, the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, a key member of Trump's administration, Vice President JD Vance said companies that build in the US will be rewarded; for companies building outside the US, ""you're on your own.""
Last week, the president said, ""I'm not even looking at the market"" as the rollout of his tariff policy shook investor confidence.
Unlike his first term in office, Trump has also not spoken explicitly about the Federal Reserve and his view on policy. (Last time around, Trump repeatedly called for lower rates.)
Instead, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has repeatedly expressed a view that Treasury yields should be lower amid Trump's push to clean up the federal budget and rein in spending across the government.
Given the speed and depth of the market's sell-off since hitting record highs on Feb. 19, however, we'll see how long the president can hold this new line.

"Delta stock falls after company cuts outlook, citing 'macro uncertainty'",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delta-stock-falls-after-company-cuts-outlook-citing-macro-uncertainty-220553333.html,"Delta Air Lines (DAL) cut its outlook for the current quarter on Monday, citing a dip in consumer and corporate confidence as well as softening domestic demand amid ""macro uncertainty.""
The company's warnings serve as one of the earliest reads on how recent volatility in markets and worries over the economic outlook are weighing on corporate performance in the first quarter of the year.
In a release ahead of an investor presentation set for Tuesday, the company said revenue growth is now expected to come in at 3%-4% for the first quarter, down from a range of 7%-9% Delta previously forecasted.
Profits are also expected to take a hit, with earnings per share expected to be in a range of $0.30-$0.50 in the first quarter, down from $0.70-$1.00 previously.
Delta stock fell as much as 13% in extended trading on Monday following the news.
Shares of Delta were down more than 16% before Monday's news amid a difficult year for the industry. The deadliest crash in the US in 16 years took place in January and then another crash in Toronto in February saw 21 passengers injured but no fatalities.
The company's comments about deteriorating sentiment among American consumers also come after stocks plunged on Monday due in part to increasingly cautious views about the US economy.
Notably, Delta highlighted that softness in domestic demand led to the lower guidance, while ""premium, international and loyalty revenue growth trends are consistent with expectations.""
This update also fits another key market narrative, where US growth forecasts have been sliding while similar outlooks in Europe have been rising.
In recent months, consumer sentiment data has tumbled and spending data has also begun to track lower. In January, consumer spending fell for the first time in nearly two years, and separate data showed retail sales saw the largest monthly decline in a year.
Meanwhile, consumer confidence saw its largest monthly decline in nearly four years during the month of February. Uncertainty about the impact of President Trump's policies has been key in driving the weakening consumer mood.
Given the market's recent drawdown amid weakening confidence from the consumer, investors have been closely watching for connections between a souring consumer and the outlook for American corporates.
""Weak confidence coincided with outflows in passive US equity funds in early February to begin the risk-off period,"" Citi head of US equity trading strategy Stuart Kaiser wrote in a note to clients on Monday. ""The clear link between policy uncertainty and retail/consumer confidence remains [an] area of concern for us with no clear source of data relief.""

"With income-driven repayment plans paused, the student loan program is in chaos",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/with-income-driven-repayment-plans-paused-the-student-loan-program-is-in-chaos-215347295.html,"It seems that nobody is quite sure what’s happening with the student loan program right now.
On Friday, a group of 25 Senate Democrats wrote to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon asking for more information about her agency’s February decision to remove the online applications for several popular income-driven repayment plans. The move has created mass uncertainty for millions of borrowers, in part because it has prevented many from filling out the annual forms necessary to keep their payments from suddenly ballooning.
“Borrowers have relied on many of these plans for decades and this sudden and reckless action means millions of borrowers have fewer repayment options available and are unsure of what to do in order to manage their debt,” states the letter, which was led by Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment from Yahoo Finance. But the letter underscores the extent to which policymakers across Washington remain in the dark about the department’s plans. Consumer groups remain equally flummoxed.
“We’re trying to get the Department of Education to just provide any sort of guidance to borrowers and the people who work with borrowers about what they’re doing, how long it’s going to go on for, and what borrowers can do in the meantime,” Abby Shafroth, director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project at the National Consumer Law Center, told Yahoo Finance. “I’d say the biggest problem right now is the lack of information.”
Late last month, the Department of Education shuttered its online application portal for income-driven repayment plans, which cap what borrowers owe each month at a portion of their earnings. In a short note posted to the top of Studentaid.gov, the agency said it removed the forms in response to a federal appeals court ruling that upheld and expanded a pause on former President Biden’s SAVE plan, which several Republican-led states have sued to end.
Read more: What is an income-driven repayment plan?
By closing the online forms, the department also blocked access to all of its other income-driven plans, which use the same application but were not part of the litigation. Shortly after, the Washington Post reported that the Education Department had sent a memo to student loan servicers instructing them to stop accepting or processing any pending IDR applications for 90 days. According to Monday’s Senate letter, there are approximately 1 million outstanding applications.
As a result of the pause, former students who are having trouble paying their loans each month do not have access to apply for more manageable repayment options, leaving them at greater risk of default and its financial consequences, such as lower credit scores.
The freeze is also causing trouble for borrowers who are currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans and are nearing the deadline to send in their annual recertification paperwork reporting their incomes for the past year. Those who fail to do so are essentially bounced back to a standard 10-year repayment plan, which can cost many times more per month, and have their outstanding interest added back to their principal. Borrowers also can’t make progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness unless they remain on an IDR plan. In its memo ordering servicers to pause IDR processing, the department also reportedly told them to stop accepting recertifications for 90 days.
Shafroth said her group has “heard rumors” that the administration is planning to push back recertification deadlines so that students can remain on IDR. “But if they have, they haven’t made that information public, and they haven’t told borrowers that,” she said. The website “The College Investor” reported Friday that the administration intends to push back the recertification deadlines, citing “sources familiar with the matter.”
The roughly 8 million borrowers who enrolled in Biden’s SAVE plan currently have their loans in an interest-free forbearance while litigation continues and do not need to update their income until 2026. But another 4.5 million are still in other income-driven plans that, as of now, require recertification, including Income-Based Repayment, Income-Contingent Repayment, and Pay As You Earn. Those borrowers can still request a normal forbearance from their servicers, but interest will accrue while their loans are paused.
Since closing off its IDR applications, the Education Department has provided just one update to borrowers, announcing that they could send in paper applications for loan consolidations. In their letter Monday, Democrats asked for basic information, such as how long the department plans to maintain its IDR application pause, and whether recertification will actually be extended.
On Reddit’s forum dedicated to student loans, borrowers have been asking each other for advice on how to deal with the processing pause and sharing stories about having attempts to recertify their loans rebuffed by loan servicers.
As one user put it: “This just all sucks, and I really hope y'all don't have renewal dates coming up soon.”

Hagerty CEO speaks: From changes in the classic car market to being the industry's 'Bloomberg',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hagerty-ceo-speaks-from-changes-in-the-classic-car-market-to-being-the-industrys-bloomberg-211703626.html,"AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. — In keeping with tradition, the Amelia Concours classic car show picked, what else, a sports car with racing heritage as its best in show.
The 1938 Alfa Romeo 8C 2900B, a car considered the best sports car of its day with a chassis derived from motorsport, took top honors. (The Amelia historically tends to focus on sports and racing cars.)
Classic car insurer Hagerty (HGTY), which has been running the Amelia for four years now, noted that getting your hands on the ultra-rare 8C 2900 will set you back a sizable amount — perhaps as much as $20 million.
But that's life — and a familiar price point — at the Amelia.
McKeel Hagerty, president and CEO of Hagerty, believes the Amelia is becoming something of a Pebble Beach for the Eastern US, where ultra-rare cars are winning prizes and coming up for auction.
“If there's one event like this, you know, with Pebble Beach in the summer, we think there's a place for Amelia to be here [in the spring], sort of permanently in people's minds,” Hagerty said in a roundtable interview. “I think we proved that there's still really this room for a classic car display and not just keep this inevitable drift towards newer and newer cars.”
The drift to newer and newer cars can be seen in auction results, especially this spring.
The preliminary totals for the spring season — which includes RM Sotheby’s last week and Gooding & Company and Hagerty’s own Broad Arrow this weekend — hit $190.3 million across the three auctions, up from $183.8 million a year ago. But the cars that have traditionally brought in the big bucks, like the Amelia-winning Alfa and other highly prized Ferraris, are seeing softness in the market.
In their place, Porsche sports cars from the 70s and up, newer Mercedes AMG vehicles, and even Japanese sports cars from the 80s and 90s are seeing higher sales.
For Hagerty, this transition in the classic car market is an opportunity.
That's because the company's insurance business has all the data from writing policies for classic cars, as well as from its relatively new auction business acquisition. That can help clients transition out of cars that may not be getting traditional values these days to other more desirable autos.
Hagerty can also use that data for newer collectors looking to get into the classic car game.
“What is the intellectual high ground in your industry? Who has it? When you think, you think Bloomberg, right [in finance]? They own the data for people who are professional traders with the Bloomberg terminals. It's a data company underneath the media side,” he said.
Hagerty believes the “intellectual high ground” in his space is not well understood and that the company and its data could bring clarity to the market. In particular, valuation data. (The company is already pursuing this through its ""Muscle Car Index” and various other metrics.)
And, of course, there is the business of Hagerty Insurance.
Last week, the company reported 20% revenue growth in 2024., with 279,000 new members joining. Hagerty believes it can hit 400,000 new members in 2025, partly because its State Farm Insurance partnership will funnel new classic car insurance shoppers its way. The company believes it could possibly add 1.5 million new policy members by 2030, doubling the business.
“So it is coming to us, and it's going to come really fast,” Hagerty said. “We have to figure out how to handle that much new business coming our way on top of what we normally would grow.”

Commentary: Elon Musk’s giant blind spot,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/commentary-elon-musks-giant-blind-spot-204816861.html,"Is there any difference between Twitter and the State Department? Elon Musk doesn’t seem to think so. He’s angry at Secretary of State Marco Rubio for not slashing the State Department payroll the way Musk did at Twitter after he bought the social media site in 2022 and turned it into X.
The inevitable clash between Chainsaw Musk and government management is finally erupting as President Trump’s Cabinet appointees push back against Musk and the efficiency commission he heads. Musk and his minions have been demanding thousands of layoffs and other draconian cost-cutting measures across the federal bureaucracy as they wage war on the administrative state. Trump’s Cabinet appointees need those resources to do their jobs, and they’ve started telling Musk to back off.
Egos are inflamed, tempers flaring. At a March 6 Cabinet meeting, Musk reportedly berated Rubio for not firing anybody, according to the New York Times, while implying that Rubio is a lightweight. Rubio said Musk was being untruthful and suggested that Musk is the phony showboater. Musk then played his trump card, reminding the room that he runs three companies worth billions of dollars apiece, as if that is all the qualification he needs to override Cabinet secretaries and cull the federal workforce.
President Trump ultimately intervened, defending Rubio and saying that department heads, not Musk, would have the final say on personnel decisions. But Musk isn’t going away, not yet anyway, and his disputes with Trump’s political appointees highlight a fatal flaw in Musk’s logic: He’s treating the federal government like a bloated, distressed company when in reality the government is nothing like a private-sector organization.
The idea of running the government like a business is a popular one. Trump himself ran on that concept in 2016, pitching himself as a dealmaker who would get better terms for America. Many critics highlighted the troubling aspects of Trump’s business background, including six bankruptcies. But voters dismissed the disses and went for a businessman president, the first since Herbert Hoover in the late 1920s.
The DOGE efficiency commission first arose as an idea when Musk interviewed Trump on Twitter last August. It was Musk’s idea, which Trump promptly endorsed. A few weeks later Trump said the job of the Musk commission, if it ever materialized, would be “conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government and making recommendations for drastic reforms.”
Musk probably had something more audacious in mind than an audit followed by recommendations. As we know now, Musk has modeled the DOGE commission on his dramatic reshaping of Twitter after he bought it in October 2022. Musk started firing workers right away and ultimately axed the staff by 75%. In lengthy meetings, he went line by line through the company budget and cut any spending staffers couldn’t justify as essential.
There were mistakes. Musk cut cleaning service contracts and nobody arrived to remove trash from the Twitter offices for a while. Remaining staffers had to bring their own toilet paper. As Musk rolled back content policies on the site, many advertisers — the company’s main source of revenue — fled. Two years after Musk bought the platform, its value had plunged by 80%.
Musk’s Twitter strategy was something only an autocratic multibillionaire could have gotten away with. Musk took Twitter private, so he didn’t have any public shareholders to answer to as the company’s value collapsed. At any normal public company, by contrast, the board would fire a CEO driving customers away and revenue down. Musk did have institutional investors who lost money as Twitter’s value dropped, but they were uniquely bound to Musk, given his control over other businesses and his ability to control future opportunities for those investors.
The other billion-dollar companies Musk bragged about in the Cabinet meeting are SpaceX and Tesla. SpaceX is also privately owned, so Musk doesn’t have to answer to public shareholders in that company, either. Tesla is different. Very different. It is publicly owned, so the CEO, Musk, is answerable to millions of individual shareholders. But Musk and his entrepreneurial moxie are also crucial parts of the Tesla brand. Plus, Musk is Tesla’s biggest shareholder, with 13% of the company. His role as co-founder, CEO, large shareholder, and face of the company gives him far more control over Tesla than almost any other CEO of a large public company.
Applying Muskonomics to the US government actually leads to two questions. One, should it be run like a business, and two, should it be run like an Elon Musk business. The answer to both questions is an easy no.
There’s nothing wrong with financial and performance audits of the US government. The Government Accounting Agency, or GAO, actually does that all the time. So do other oversight branches.
There’s a big difference, though, between the mission of the government and the mission of a for-profit company. This is where the biggest fallacy of Musk’s DOGE mentality resides. You can’t measure the performance of a government agency the way you measure the performance of a for-profit company because their missions are dramatically different.
For-profit companies in a capitalist economy have one basic job: make money. A CEO’s job is to maximize shareholder value, and the market measures whether that is happening every trading day through the stock price.
The government is an anti-corporation. Its job is to do the things the market does poorly, or not at all, because there’s no way to make money doing them in a way that serves the public interest. That’s why the government is responsible for national defense, foreign relations, protecting the vulnerable, building and maintaining infrastructure, and enforcing laws that apply equally to everybody. If a for-profit company ran the US military, there’d never be enough troops or weapons for the worst-case scenarios that are a staple of military planning but anathema to cost-cutters.
The government provides taxpayer value, which, unlike shareholder value, isn’t assessed every day in the markets. But the public does assess taxpayer value every two or four years, when there are elections. Voters don’t want their taxpayer dollars wasted, but they certainly do want the trains to run on time and the potholes to get fixed. Once the government fails to fulfill its basic duties, its stock plunges via falling approval ratings and the bosses get fired in elections.
Musk is applying corporate strategy — and an odd one, at that — to the anti-corporation. He’s confusing shareholder value with taxpayer value. He’s also acting like the sole owner of the US government, as if he can Twitterize it into a shell of its former self while the best anybody else can do is grumble.
It's a symptom of Trump’s own fuzzy concept of the businessman president that he’s given Musk as much leash as he has. Trump touts himself as a builder, not a slasher: a dealmaker, not a dictator. As president, Trump will get the bill for whatever Musk breaks, while Musk moves on to whatever catches his attention next.
Maybe Musk should return to where he came from. The biggest source of his wealth, Tesla, is facing a crisis of its own as Musk’s newly radical political agenda degrades the electric car company’s image as an environmental do-gooder. Tesla’s stock has plunged more than 50% since late December, which may be the market telling Musk he needs to spend more time on his own company and less on outside projects. Musk’s own personal fortune has lost $150 billion in value during that time, mainly through the falling value of his Tesla shares.
There's one consolation for Musk, though: He’s still rich enough to listen to nobody but himself, including six bankruptcies. But voters dismissed the disses and went for a businessman president.

"Nvidia, Tesla slammed as 'Magnificent 7' names lead market lower in Monday washout",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-tesla-slammed-as-magnificent-7-names-lead-market-lower-in-monday-washout-142510416.html,"The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks were at the center of another sell-off that crushed the US stock market on Monday.
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) all fell, with Tesla falling a whopping 15% to lead losses.
Five of the seven megacap names saw drops of over 4%; only Microsoft (down 3.3%) and Amazon (down 2.3%) saw narrower losses.
The selling pressure hitting the Magnificent Seven came after US markets suffered their worst week of the year as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell into correction last Thursday — defined as a 10% decline from its most recent closing high. Monday served as the worst day of the year for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Dow (^DJI), while the Nasdaq suffered its sharpest one-day decline since Sept. 2022.
The S&P 500 is now less than 2% away from entering a correction and is trading at its lowest level since Sept. 12, 2024.
Last week, Nvidia stock lost $1 trillion from its record highs reached last year, while losses on Tesla stock reached 50% from its record close back in December.
Nvidia has been the biggest winner from the AI boom that kicked off in 2023, while Tesla's stock — which has ebbed and flowed throughout the company's history — was an initial winner following President Trump's election win after CEO Elon Musk became one of Trump's biggest backers on the campaign trail. Musk is now leading Trump's government efficiency push.

In a note to clients published late Sunday, RBC's equity strategy team, led by Lori Calvasina, wrote that ""investor, corporate, and political vibes have continued to weaken.""
""We continue to believe that the risk of a growth scare (14-20% drawdown peak to trough) in the S&P 500 has risen,"" she wrote.
Mike Wilson, strategist at Morgan Stanley, said he sees the S&P 500 falling another 5% in a client note this weekend.
Earlier this month, strategists at Bank of America flagged the risk of a post-election ""bro bubble"" popping and argued that should the S&P 500 erase its post-election gains, ""investors currently long risk would very much expect and need some verbal support for markets from policymakers.""
Speaking to reporters last Thursday, President Trump said, ""I'm not even looking at the stock market,"" an approach that is in contrast to his first term in office, when Trump embraced the stock market as a scorecard for the administration's economic policy. Amid ongoing pressures from his burgeoning trade war, Trump on Sunday declined to rule out the possibility of a recession this year, saying the economy was in a period of ""transition.""
This week, inflation data due out Wednesday will be the biggest update for investors looking to the Federal Reserve for signs the central bank might ease policy more aggressively than anticipated this year. Data on job openings due out Tuesday morning will add more color to the labor market picture, which appeared steadier than feared in Friday's jobs report.
As Moody's economist Mark Zandi told Yahoo Finance last week: ""There's a lot of clouds out there, some storms, things are getting pretty dark.""

"Tesla stock tumbles over 15%, wiping out post-election gains as demand worries continue to weigh",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-tumbles-over-15-wiping-out-post-election-gains-as-demand-worries-continue-to-weigh-161337256.html,"Tesla stock (TSLA) fell more than 15% on Monday as another bearish call from Wall Street sent shares to their lowest level since before the presidential election and more than 50% from its record closing high of $479 seen on Dec. 17.
Shares registered their worst day since September 2020.
In a note to clients on Monday, analysts at UBS lowered their price target on the stock to $225 from $259, citing lower delivery forecasts for the first quarter it sees resulting from softer demand for Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The firm maintained a Sell rating on the stock.
UBS now expects the company to deliver 367,000 cars in the first quarter, down from the 437,000 it said it had ""plugged in as a placeholder"" after Tesla's fourth quarter results in late January.
The firm now sees deliveries falling 5% over last year and 26% from the prior quarter in Q1, adding: ""Our UBS Evidence Lab data shows low delivery times for the Model 3 and Model Y (generally within 2 weeks) in key markets which we believe is indicative of softer demand.""
The stock was also pressured by news that shipments in China fell 49% from last year in February to the lowest level in almost three years.
With Monday's drop, Tesla stock has now forfeited more than all of its post-election gains, with this decline another piece of the persistent unwind of the ""Trump trade"" that has defined market action in recent weeks.
Tesla stock has dropped more than 20% since the start of March alone.
Still, the plunge has prompted some of Tesla's biggest bulls to come out in defense of the name in recent days. Last Thursday, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives doubled down on his pro-Tesla views, calling the current slump a ""gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves).""
Ives added Tesla to the firm's ""Best Ideas List"" and reiterated his Outperform rating and $550 price target. He also noted this is not the first time Tesla has seen a drawdown of this magnitude, writing, ""There have been a number of times in the Tesla story over the past decade that negative sentiment and Street worries have overshadowed the narrative of this unique disruptive global tech story.""
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas also recently reiterated his bullish view on Tesla, forecasting shares will rise to $430 as the company diversifies into artificial intelligence and robotics. The analyst reinstated Tesla as a top pick for the auto sector.
""Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,"" wrote Jonas in early March. He added the company's 2025 deliveries could decline year over year, but that this would be ""creating an attractive entry point"" for investors.
As Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian recently pointed out, while new competition has eaten into Tesla's sales, there is also the effect of CEO Elon Musk and his foray into politics. Musk became one of Trump's key surrogates on the campaign trail in the final months of the 2024 election.
Registration data shows Tesla car sales falling in Europe while the firing of government workers by the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have prompted protests at showrooms across the country.
Recent surveys show that many voters disapprove of Musk's actions, with a Quinnipiac poll from late January finding that voters oppose Musk playing a prominent role in the Trump administration by a 53% to 39% margin.
Tesla is expected to report its first quarter results on April 22.

"Stock market today: Dow sinks 900 points, Nasdaq plunges 4% in worst day since 2022",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sinks-900-points-nasdaq-plunges-4-in-worst-day-since-2022-183552751.html,"US stocks plunged on Monday as investors processed growing concerns about the health of the US economy after President Trump and his top economic officials acknowledged the possibility of a potential rough patch.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell nearly 900 points, or over 2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped around 2.7% after the index posted its worst week since September.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 4% in its worst day since 2022, as the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks led the sell-off. Tesla's (TSLA) rout continued, plunging 15% and officially wiping out the gains it had made in the wake of Trump's election win. Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta (META) all each lost more than 4%.
All three major indexes built on losses of more than 2% last week as the Nasdaq plummeted deeper into correction territory.
March's market struggles continue to be fueled by worries over the health of the US economy. Those concerns have become wrapped up in Trump's ongoing trade salvo, as tariff negotiations between the US, Mexico, and Canada dominate the headlines. In a Sunday interview on Fox News, Trump addressed concerns about a potential recession, describing the economy as undergoing “a period of transition.”

The political uncertainty is expected to persist into this week, with key economic data adding to the mix of potential market-moving factors. Updates on the inflationary picture will be in focus, with the February Consumer Price Index scheduled for release on Wednesday and the Producer Price Index set to follow on Thursday.
The Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped 4% on Monday as investors headed for the exits over fears of a US slowdown.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell more than 880 points after dropping as much as 1,100 during the session. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 2.7% following the index's worst week since September.
Tesla's (TSLA) rout persisted, tumbling 15% and officially wiping out the gains it had made in the wake of Trump's election win.
AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), iPhone maker Apple (AAPL), Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG), and social media giant Meta (META) all declined as much as 5% before closing off the session lows.

Tech stocks accelerated their losses on Monday afternoon with the S&P 500 Tech sector (XLK) falling more than 4%.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks led the declines, with shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA) falling more than 13% in afternoon trading.
Investors sought refuge in Utilities (XLU), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Staples (XLP).

Tesla stock (TSLA) tumbled nearly 14% while AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) also declined 5%. Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) dropped.
Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices hovered below $80,000 per token on Monday as a broader market sell-off intensified on Wall Street, overshadowing last week's positive developments for the industry.
The world's largest cryptocurrency failed to hold a meaningful leg higher after a strategic reserve announcement, followed by Friday's White House crypto summit.
Bitcoin is down more than 4% over the past 24 hours as investors became risk-off over concerns of an economic slowdown.
Economists are growing more concerned about the path forward for the US economy as President Trump's tariff policies become reality.
In a research note on Monday, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius slashed his team's 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from 2.4% while boosting their projection for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to end the year at 3%, up from a prior call in the mid 2% range. Hatzius noted these updates mark the first time in about two and a half years that his team has projected GDP growth below Bloomberg consensus data (which currently calls for above 2% growth).
""The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse,"" Hatzius wrote.
Hatzius's team now sees the average US tariff rate rising by 10 percentage points this year, twice their previous forecast and five times the level seen during Trump's first administration. Tariffs weigh on the overall economic outlook through several levers, Hatzius said.
First, the new duties are expected to push up consumer prices and, therefore, cut real income for consumers. Second, they usually come alongside tighter financial conditions. And third, the uncertainty surrounding the tariff implementation will likely prompt businesses to ""delay investment.""
Hatzius believes the combination of slower growth and sticky inflation can still leave room for the Federal Reserve to cut twice this year in June and December. But for now, Trump's policy uncertainty likely keeps the central bank holding rates steady.
""Our near-term view is that the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] will want to stay on the sidelines and make as little news as possible until the policy outlook has become clearer,"" Hatzius said.

Mortgage giant Rocket Companies (RKT) announced Monday it struck a deal to purchase digital real estate brokerage Redfin (RDFN) in an all-stock deal valued at $1.75 billion.
Redfin stock rose as much as 76% on the news. Rocket stock fell as much as 10%.
According to a statement announcing the deal, Redfin shareholders will receive just less than 0.8 shares of Rocket stock for each share of Redfin owned. Current Rocket shareholders will own about 95% of the combined company.
Rocket shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $0.80 per share. The deal values Redfin at $12.50 per share.
The companies said the combined company should be able to cut about $140 million of operations and other costs by 2027 and realize an additional $60 million in savings from pairing Redfin agents with Rocket's financing infrastructure.
The deal was approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2025.
Upon the agreement, Redfin CEO Glenn Kelman will continue to run Redfin’s business, reporting to Rocket Companies’ CEO Varun Krishna.
Selling on Wall Street resumed on Monday following the worst week for the S&P 500 since September as Wall Street continues to price in a potential economic impact from the Trump administration's evolving tariff policy.
The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks led the sell-off as the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell roughly 2% after slipping into correction territory last Thursday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) tumbled 1.5% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also sank nearly 1%.
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) were all down more than 2% in early trading.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson joined the group of strategists sounding the economic risk alarm over President Trump's tariff policies.
Wilson forecast the S&P 500 could drop as much as 5% in the first half of the year due to the impact of levies and less fiscal spending.
US stock futures accelerated losses 30 minutes before the opening bell as economic concerns mounted ahead of Wednesday's inflation report.
Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 1.1%, while futures attached to the benchmark S&P 500 (ES=F) dropped 1.4%. Futures tied to the Nasdaq (NQ=F) plummeted 1.6%.
Stocks continued a rough start to March after the Nasdaq Composite entered correction territory last week while the S&P 500 logged its worst week since September.
Crypto also saw losses in premarket trading, as President Trump's crypto reserve announcement last week did little to ease sentiment. Bitcoin dropped nearly 2% to trade around the $83,000 level.
Shares of Tesla (TSLA) also dropped 3.8% and Nvidia (NVDA) lost 2.7%, weighing on markets. Reddit (RDDT) stock extended heavy losses, down about 4.7%.
Ford stock (F) fell over 1% in premarket trading after the automaker announced a 4.4 billion euro ($4.76 billion) investment into its struggling German business.

Stock market sell-off: Why these stocks are in the green amid the pain,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-sell-off-why-these-stocks-are-in-the-green-amid-the-pain-181712451.html,"Not every sector is getting pummeled by the Trump tariff rout that is currently enveloping the broader markets.
Consumer staples — from companies that sell soda to those offering healthcare services and energy — continue to attract their fair share of inflows as traders seek out businesses less tied to economic cyclicality. Case in point in Monday's highly volatile trading session.
Shares of Coca-Cola (KO) are up 2% on the session, while rival PepsiCo (PEP) is up 3%. Procter & Gamble (PG) shares are up 1.2%. The iShares US Healthcare ETF (IYH) is up slightly, powered by gains in top holdings Merck (MRK) and Amgen (AMGN).
The IYH has tacked on 1.2% in March. The three aforementioned stocks have all notched gains so far in March, compared to a 3.1% drop for the S&P 500.
Watch: Gap CEO is monitoring tariffs every hour
The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) — comprised of key US utilities like Duke Energy (DUK) and Constellation Energy (CEG) — is up about 1%. It's relatively unchanged in March, outperforming the S&P 500.
Health Care (XLV), Utilities (XLU), and Consumer Staples (XLP) are some of the best-performing sectors of the S&P 500 this year.
The shift to staples has been dramatic enough to push the ratio of consumer staples stocks to consumer discretionary stock from a multiyear low to a multi-month high, according to new data from Sundial Capital Research.
""On a relative basis, staples are more defensive, and portfolio managers live in a relative world. And as much as tariff concerns are dominating, the market is growing increasingly concerned about an economic slowdown. So traders are going back to the traditional playbook, irrespective of tariffs, toward staples, in which products will still need to be bought even if the economy slows,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told me.
Meantime, the broader market continues to take it on the chin.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) plunged more than 600 points in afternoon trading Monday as traders grew antsy on the economic growth outlook with Trump tariffs lurking. Trump not ruling out a recession in a Sunday Fox News interview hasn't helped the increasingly bearish sentiment.
The Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) finished below its closely watched 200-day moving average last week for the first time in nearly two years, per data from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. The 200-day moving average is a technical measure of longer-term sentiment on an index or stock.
It represented the end of the second-longest uptrend in history for the Nasdaq 100 at 497 days. During this stretch, the Nasdaq 100 notched a 73% return.
The Dow, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 (^GSPC) are all lower on the year. The Nasdaq has been the worst performer with a nearly 10% drop.
""Anything is possible in Trump World. We can't rule out the possibility that a bear market started on Feb. 20, the day after the S&P 500 rose to a record high. It could be like the 'flash crashes' that occurred during 1962 and 1987. It could happen quickly and reverse just as quickly. So the sell-off could provide buying opportunities, especially in overvalued names that are now less so,"" said longtime market watcher Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research.
Listen: Why this toy CEO is worried about tariffs
BCA Research's veteran strategist Peter Berezin said in a new piece of research that he sees a 75% chance of a recession within the next three months. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius has raised his US recession probability to 20% from 15%.
""In this administration, there's a different focus, I think, on the tariff discussion where the administration is looking at trade imbalances and trying to use tariffs against many different companies in a more universal fashion. And so that has created, at least in the short term, a lot more uncertainty,"" Newell Brands (NWL) CEO Chris Peterson told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.

Goldman Sachs slashes US economic forecasts as tariff impacts grow 'considerably more adverse',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-slashes-us-economic-forecasts-as-tariff-impacts-grow-considerably-more-adverse-170805099.html,"Goldman Sachs is the latest Wall Street firm to grow more concerned about the path forward for the US economy as President Trump's tariff policies become reality.
In a research note on Monday, Goldman's economics team led by Jan Hatzius slashed its 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from 2.4%.
""The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse,"" Hatzius wrote.
In its note, Goldman also boosted its projection for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to end the year at 3%, up from a prior call in the mid 2% range.
Hatzius noted these updates mark the first time in about two and a half years that his team has projected GDP growth below Bloomberg consensus data, which currently calls for GDP growth north of 2% this year.
Goldman is the latest in a slew of forecasting teams that now see a more dire outlook for the US economy.
In a note to clients on Friday, Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen moved his 2025 growth forecast down to 1.5% from 1.9% previously.
Gapen also sees the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — the ""core"" Personal Consumption Expenditures index — ending the year higher, projecting core PCE to end 2025 at 2.7%, up from a previous projection of 2.5%.
In its note on Monday, Goldman's team said it now sees the average US tariff rate rising by 10 percentage points this year, twice their previous forecast and five times the level seen during Trump's first administration.
Tariffs weigh on the overall economic outlook through three key levers, Hatzius wrote.

""Our near-term view is that the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] will want to stay on the sidelines and make as little news as possible until the policy outlook has become clearer,"" Hatzius said.
And while still not the base case, discussions of recession have also picked up from various sources.
Former PIMCO CEO Mohamed El-Erian told Yahoo Finance Monday he now sees a 25% to 30% chance the US economy enters recession this year, up from a 10% chance seen before the Trump tariff bonanza began.
Betting markets are pricing in an increasing chance the US economy tips into recession, with Polymarket placing the odds that a US recession is officially called by year-end at roughly 40% as of Monday, up from a 23% chance on Feb. 27.
The downshift in economic growth forecasts has also coincided with a broad risk-off trade in the stock market. On Monday, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down more than 3%, led by large losses in popular tech names like Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA).

"Tariffs topple stocks, no sign of 'Trump put'",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tariffs-topple-stocks-no-sign-053143450.html,"A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Tom Westbrook
U.S. stocks finally caught up overnight with what currency and bond markets have been saying for several weeks: A slowdown is coming.
The Nasdaq's 4% fall was its steepest in two-and-a-half years. Bond yields fell sharply and markets are now pricing in a roughly 50-50 probability of the Fed cutting rates in May.
Tesla shares have halved since their post-election peaks and the dollar, which had been rising in anticipation of Donald Trump's policies, has now begun sliding as he slaps tariffs on his neighbours.
The so-called ""Trump trade"" is in full retreat and the ""Trump put"", or the expectation that he may be sensitive to falls in the stock market, is so far nowhere to be seen.
Citi downgraded its U.S. asset allocation recommendation, cutting stocks to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"" after the market closed, saying that for the next few months at least it's not clear that the U.S. economy's outperformance can continue.
Asian markets did their best to steady the ship, helped a bit because it's everywhere outside the U.S. that stands to benefit from any repatriation flows from dumped U.S. assets.
Stocks in Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Sydney were off their early lows by the afternoon, but the mood was skittish. U.S. equity futures also fell in early trade and, while recovering their losses, are struggling to make much headway beyond flat. [MKTS/GLOB]
The scene in currency markets was quiet. The yen has been rising for weeks and inched to a new five-month peak in the Asia session - although, as some dealers noted, it's stocks catching up to the move in dollar/yen rather than the other way around.
The euro, too, has shown little reaction to Germany's Greens promising to block plans for increased military spending, perhaps in anticipation of a compromise deal.
Key developments that could influence markets on Tuesday:

The mood in financial markets remained nervous after Wall Street investors tempered their bullish views amid concerns that tariffs and government spending cuts will torpedo growth in the world’s largest economy. Equity-index futures for the S&P 500 gained as much as 0.3% after losing more than 1% in early Asian trading. Contracts for Nasdaq 100 and European stocks both advanced as well.
Asian shares fell to a five-week low Tuesday after the Nasdaq 100 had its worst day since 2022. Equity indexes in Hong Kong and China also trimmed their declines. Yields on 2-year Treasuries recovered after slumping to the lowest level since October and a gauge of the dollar slipped.
Two months into the presidency of Donald Trump, global market sentiment has turned downbeat as investors become increasingly concerned about US economic growth after a tariff war, spending cuts and a shakeup of decades-old geopolitical relationships. Some investors see the shift in mood as an opportunity to purchase shares, especially in Hong Kong and China, where the there’s anticipation that the government will come out with measures to stimulate the economy.
“The handful of people I managed to speak to this morning, most are still looking for opportunities to buy if markets correct,” said Kok Hoong Wong, head of institutional equities sales trading at Maybank Securities. “HK/China could be an interesting candidate for this.”
Despite the global risk-off mood, mainland Chinese investors bought an unprecedented amount of Hong Kong stocks on Monday, continuing to boost their holdings amid a tech-driven rally this year. The stocks have been on a tear this year, thanks to the emergence of an artificial-intelligence model from startup DeepSeek that was considered a game-changer in the industry.
China may be relatively more resilient given the policy divergences amid the National People’s Congress meeting, said Marvin Chen, a strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.
Earlier, Australian stocks touched the lowest in seven months and the Nikkei-225 Index sank to the lowest since September.

Investors have been increasing hedges by shorting futures and options, and that often exacerbates selling, said Rajeev De Mello, a global macro portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management. Even after Monday’s rebound, De Mello said he remains wary.
“I remain cautious as investor sentiment has turned increasingly risk-averse,” he said.
Citigroup Inc. strategists downgraded US stocks to neutral from overweight while upgrading China to overweight, saying US exceptionalism is at least on pause. Citi raised China to overweight as the country looks attractive even after the rally.
Earlier, HSBC strategists raised their rating on European equities, excluding the UK, to overweight from underweight as they expect euro-zone fiscal stimulus to be “a potential game-changer.”
In the US Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%. The Nasdaq 100 lost 3.8%. In the megacap space, Tesla Inc. sank 15% while Nvidia Corp. drove a closely watched gauge of chipmakers to the lowest since April. About 10 high-grade companies delayed US bond sales.
“The selloff felt like a liquidation of any overweight/crowded positions, combined with a buyers’ strike,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. “Regarding the buying strike, why buy now when Trump is not concerned with the stock market and Powell said he’s not in a rush?”
Here’s what Markets Live Strategist Garfield Reynolds says:
“The US-centered selloff spreading across global equity markets may be getting extra spice from the perception that central bankers aren’t about to rush to the rescue this time round. Investors have to take into account the potential that monetary settings will remain at levels that in many economies are still seen as being at least somewhat restrictive for a while yet.”
Most Group-of-10 currencies rose against the greenback on Tuesday, with only the Australian and New Zealand dollars down in the session. The Swiss franc and Japanese yen, traditional havens, outperformed. The euro continues to attract buyers with its surge in the region’s growth prospects.
In commodities, oil fell for a second day, tracking a plunge in equity markets and other risk assets on concerns tariffs and other measures will stunt growth in the world’s largest economy. Gold increased slightly. Cryptocurrencies slid further as fears over a selloff in US equities eclipsed Trump’s recent efforts to buttress the industry.

Eastern Australia is facing an energy shortfall as older offshore gas fields are depleted, according to Rystad Energy. There’s limited pipeline capacity to ship LNG thousands of miles from major production hubs in the northwest of the country, and the grid operator has repeatedly warned of potential shortages in the populous southeast as soon as 2027.
New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania are already “testing their gas supply security for winter,” Kaushal Ramesh, Rystad Energy’s vice president for gas & LNG research, said in a note. That risks a repeat of an energy crunch three years ago, he said.
“Compared to the crisis year of 2022, these states now have severely diminished buffer capacity, which could trigger another price surge if multiple supply and demand shocks occur,” Ramesh said. “Even in our most optimistic scenario, LNG imports to Australia are looking like an inevitability.”
Energy policy is likely to take center stage in elections due by mid-May, where the ruling Labor party’s target to generate 82% of electricity from renewables will face off against the opposition’s pledge to build nuclear reactors, the research group said.
The Victorian government will push for the Australian Energy Market Operator to become an anchor buyer of LNG at a meeting of state and federal energy ministers on Friday, according to a report Monday in The Australian newspaper. Companies including billionaire Andrew Forrest’s Squadron Energy, Viva Energy Group and Royal Vopak NV have proposed LNG import terminals.
Australia would not be the first gas exporter that would need to turn to imports, although countries including Egypt and Indonesia have mainly needed to do so to meet increasing domestic demand caused by rapid population growth.
“It is ridiculous that one of the world’s largest gas exporters is looking to import gas,” said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee. “There is still ample gas in Queensland, where the LNG export projects are, but pipeline and storage constraints can still limit gas capacity in the southern states when it is suddenly needed.”

"China's Xpeng may invest up to $13.8 billion in humanoid robots, state media reports",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-xpeng-may-invest-13-051515138.html,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng sees humanoid robots as a long-term project and is considering large investments that could go up to 100 billion yuan ($13.80 billion), state media reported its CEO as saying on Monday.
CEO He Xiaopeng said on the sidelines of the annual parliamentary session that while the company's current investment could be considered conservative given how it was in the early stages of entering the sector, it was ready to invest much more, the Securities Times reported.
""Xpeng has been working in the humanoid robot industry for five years, may continue to be in the business for another 20 years, invest additional 50 billion yuan and even 100 billion yuan,"" He said, without disclosing the company's current investment.
The Guangzhou-based EV maker entered the humanoid robot industry in 2020 and unveiled its humanoid Iron in November to rival Tesla Bot.
Xpeng is among an increasing number of automakers betting on humanoids, which Chinese policymakers have signalled as an area they want to see tech breakthroughs in.
Stellantis-backed Leapmotor has set up a robot team of dozens of people, which is currently in the pre-research stage, CEO Zhu Jiangming told reporters on Tuesday. The products are aimed at adoption in industrial scenarios such as Leapmotor factory assemblies where robots can replace human to improve work efficiency.
Automakers could invest 1-2 billion yuan per year in applicable scenarios to deploy humanoid robots, according to He, the Economic View report on Tuesday.

US legal troubles for tycoon Adani expose shortcomings in India's booming solar sector,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-legal-troubles-tycoon-adani-050424340.html,"BENGALURU, India (AP) — President Donald Trump's decision to freeze a law banning business bribes overseas could offer Indian tycoon Gautam Adani, one of Asia's richest people, a reprieve from American corruption allegations linked to a major solar project in India.
U.S. prosecutors allege that one of Adani's companies duped investors by hiding that its project was backed by a $265 million bribery scheme. The case now may be reviewed, and enforcement of any potential decision against it is uncertain. Whatever its fate, the case has highlighted vulnerabilities in India’s solar sector that are hindering its capacity to switch to clean energy, help limit climate change and cut heavy pollution in many of its cities.
The Adani Group, whose business interests span much of the economy from ports and airports to energy and media, has denied the U.S. allegations. It declined requests from The Associated Press for comment.
Earlier this month, Trump suspended the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, raising expectations among some in India that the allegations against Adani might be put on ice. Shares in Adani’s companies surged but then fell just days later when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sought help from Indian authorities in serving its complaint against Adani.
The allegations have had wider repercussions outside India. Adani Green Energy has withdrawn its wind energy projects from Sri Lanka after the island nation sought to renegotiate prices. Kenya canceled energy and airport expansion deals with the company, while investor TotalEnergies, a French oil giant, has paused new investments.
Adani's energy projects
Adani Green Energy, or AGEL, is India’s largest renewable energy company. It is building one of the world’s largest clean power projects in salt deserts bordering Pakistan in the Western Indian state of Gujarat. Once completed, they would produce 30 gigawatts of clean power, enough to power nearly 18 million Indian homes.
AGEL has projects in 12 Indian states, with 11.6 gigawatts of clean power capacity. It aims to generate 50 gigawatts of renewable power by 2030, a tenth of India’s clean energy goal for the same time period.
In November, Adani said his company would invest $35 billion over five years in large-scale solar, wind, and hybrid power plants across India. It is also one of the country's few large-scale producers of solar and wind power components. But the industry itself is struggling.
Cash-strapped Indian states
India's state-owned electricity companies are chronically short on cash. By 2022-23 their losses totaled $7.8 billion — 2.4% of India’s GDP, according to government data. Operations are plagued by bad planning, fears of public anger over higher electricity rates and large electricity losses during transmission.
“Waiving the costs upfront makes it cheap for those building power plants, but ultimately the system has to bear that cost,” said Rohit Chandra, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi.
Accommodating inevitable fluctuations in solar and wind power is also costly, said Vibhuti Garg, an energy economist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. That means keeping expensive coal power on standby.
Renewable energy is cheaper than coal in India, but utilities still view clean power as just a “statutory obligation,” said Alexander Hogeveen Rutter, an energy analyst in Bengaluru.
A backfiring federal scheme
To troubleshoot state utilities' financial woes, the federal government agency established the Solar Energy Corporation of India, or SECI, to help manage risks.
SECI awarded a contract of 12 gigawatts of solar energy to the Adani Group and another New York Stock Exchange-listed company, Azure Power, at a specific price. The U.S. indictment alleges that state utilities balked at buying power at that rate and that the bribery was aimed at getting them to sign on.
Azure Power said in a statement in November that it was cooperating with American agencies and that it had ceased to employ the people mentioned in the indictment. SECI didn't respond to queries from The Associated Press.
SECI doesn’t buy clean power but facilitates sales to Indian states. That cuts risks of power developers going unpaid but it has raised administrative costs, Rutter said. ""This whole scheme, which was supposed to drive down costs is actually driving up costs,” he said.
Rising manufacturing costs
India restricts imports of cheap Chinese solar modules and is subsidizing local manufacturers. That helped raise domestic production by six-fold in 2021-2023, according to the Press Trust of India, though Indian-made solar components are more expensive than Chinese one.
But India lags behind countries like Brazil and Australia in rooftop solar, having installed only 11 gigawatts so far -– far less than the 40 gigawatts it aimed to have by 2022. Policies favoring large installations have constrained growth of solar, which mainly comes from football-field-sized farms, Rutter said.
Many large renewable energy companies, like Adani's, manufacture parts like solar panels and cells to help reduce their own costs and remain profitable while selling power at lower prices acceptable to the state-owned utilities, Garg said. But this limits competition since small companies — considered vital for India's clean energy ambitions — can't match the prices set by corporate giants that make the equipment used to generate solar power.
A weak regulatory framework
The U.S. indictment has exposed weaknesses spots in India’s regulatory framework, which is prone to “crony relationships” between companies and the government, said Joe Athialy, executive director of the New Delhi-based Centre for Financial Accountability.
Most government bids are conducted transparently, with some even driving down prices to unviable levels, said Vinay Rustagi, an independent energy consultant. But occasional “one-off tenders” are poorly publicized or slip under the radar, limiting competition.
The fraud allegations against Adani reflect ""an extreme example of trying to combine solar project development with solar manufacturing,” he said.
Slowing solar
Slower progress for India's transition away from fossil fuels matters. It's the most populous nation, with 1.4 billion people in 2023, and its electricity demand is projected to grow by at least 6% annually for the next few years, according to the International Energy Agency.
India's solar capacity has been growing rapidly with record-high solar power installations reported in 2024. But while solar makes up 16% of India's total generating capacity, it accounts for only 4% of the electricity used, according to government data compiled by IEEFA. The global average was over 5% in 2023, according to the London-based think tank Ember.
By late 2024, SECI still didn’t have buyers for 9 gigawatts or more than a third of the 24.5 gigawatts of solar power capacity it can offer.
As is true in many places, insufficient storage capacity means solar projects struggle to find buyers since the utilities prefer to purchase stable, ready-to-use power. This is why only 16% of last year’s new solar projects had found buyers by November, compared to 44% the year before, according to a report by the financial services firm JM Financial Institutional Securities.
“India’s solar story, while still growing, is slowing down,” said Chandra.

Tank Builder’s Stock Now Hotter Than LVMH in New European Order,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tank-builder-stock-now-hotter-050000855.html,"(Bloomberg) -- A rush by European governments to boost military spending has unleashed a rally in defense stocks so strong that they’re now as richly valued as the region’s high-flying luxury names.

Shares in German tanks and ammunition producer Rheinmetall AG have jumped more than 80% this year. That’s pushed its valuation multiple to a record, somewhere between Dior owner LVMH and Birkin bag maker Hermès International SCA.
Other European defense stocks including Thales SA and Leonardo SpA have also soared and the test now is whether the companies can live up to the earnings growth expectations investors have placed on them, to match the headspinning advance in their share prices. That intensifies the focus on Rheinmetall’s results, due Wednesday.
Bulls base their confidence on Germany’s newly announced pledge to unlock hundreds of billions of euros for military spending and its push for European Union leaders to follow suit. Such is the level of investor optimism that defense shares barely flinched on news of Germany’s Green party rejecting the plan. It’s a shift that turns an historically low-growth corner of the stock market into one that has the potential to rapidly expand.
Valuations for defense stocks have raced ahead as investors snap up the shares much faster than analysts have managed to rework their price targets to account for an anticipated rush of government orders.
“The growth outlook for these companies is very different today than it was six months ago,” Graeme Bencke, a fund manager at Amati Global Investors, said in an interview. “We need to expect that they look expensive right now because the market and the Street haven’t really had a chance to upgrade earnings.”
There’s clear evidence that analysts haven’t kept up with the breakneck rally. While Rheinmetall’s average price-target has shot up by more than 60% since the start of the year, it suggests less than 10% upside over the next 12 months. The company’s earnings will shine a spotlight on its prospects for the year to come, possibly prompting analysts to lift their expectations.
Investors are keenly watching which areas within defense will be earmarked by governments for increased spending, as well as guidance from companies, to get a clearer picture of how to value stocks in the sector.
“The debate in the market is whether you can start considering a double-digit growth rate for some of these businesses,” said Robert Lancastle, a portfolio manager at J O Hambro which owns shares in Thales, Leonardo and Saab AB. “And if you think that there is a double-digit growth rate — which we don’t think is implausible — actually companies like Thales don’t look wildly expensive.”
Even so, opportunities for good entry points may become scarcer. As investors increasingly price in the double-digit growth opportunity, it “makes them incrementally less attractive to invest in,” he said in an interview.
For some, valuations have already become stretched, particularly given Rheinmetall’s shares have surged more than 1,000% since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.
Warburg Research analyst Christian Cohrs downgraded his recommendation on Rheinmetall to hold from buy last week, saying the shares already reflect government budgets pushing defense spending toward 3% of gross domestic product. “Against this backdrop we encourage investors to lock in some profits,” he said in a note.
On Friday, Kepler Cheuvreux’s Aymeric Poulain gave Hensoldt AG, another German defense name, its second downgrade of the week. “The speed at which the share is discounting the future is dangerous as it underplays execution risks,” he wrote in a note.
And then there is the question of transparency around state defense spending. Revenue visibility is “far from perfect,” said Jens-Peter Rieck, an equity analyst at Mwb Research. “Many defense programs remain classified, and long-term planning depends heavily on political decisions and evolving security needs.”
But as a few lose their nerve, others are steadfastly bullish.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists said in a March 7 note that their basket of European defense stocks had surged 70% since the start of the year, without the sector becoming overvalued. “European defense companies are starting to be expensive, even compared to their US peers, but the growth expectations are so elevated they look fairly valued when look on the price/earnings growth ratio,” the team including Guillaume Jaisson wrote.
Over at JPMorgan Chase & Co., the view is that “there is more to go” for European defense stocks, according to strategists including Mislav Matejka.
“We remain bullish on defense names, irrespective of a potential Ukraine ceasefire,” Matejka and his colleagues wrote in a note Monday.

China Boosts Two-Year Bond Sales to Record Amid Debt Selloff,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-boosts-two-bond-sales-044758906.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese bonds face a crucial test this week as the government plans a record issuance of two-year notes just when a debt-market selloff is worsening.

The finance ministry said in a statement it is planning to sell 167 billion yuan ($23 billion) of two-year government bonds on Friday, the largest-ever offering of the tenor in a single auction, according to Bloomberg compiled data. The move may challenge China’s debt market, as any signs of weak demand in auctions may accelerate a rout that’s already sent the benchmark yield to the highest level this year.
Chinese bond yields have jumped this year due to the PBOC’s reluctance to ease monetary policy, tight liquidity and optimism toward Chinese stocks. The yield on two-year government debt rose to its highest since October Monday, having surged about 50 basis points since early January, which may deter investors from buying bonds fearing further losses.
The yield on 30-year government bond briefly rose above 2% for the first time this year as the selloff extended on Tuesday. The yield on two-year note was little changed on Tuesday, while that on the benchmark 10-year debt climbed three basis points to 1.9%.
Also on Friday, another 30 billion yuan of 30-year notes will be auctioned, same with the previous issuance.
Bond losses accelerated in the past few weeks amid weak demand for notes. One-year yield gained over nine basis points on February 14, the most since 2023, after an auction saw elevated yield on marginal bids. Last week, another batch of one-year notes was sold at the highest yield since April 2024.
It may be too early to say the auction result will turn out to be very poor, said Zhaopeng Xing, senior strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group. However, in any case, the auction result will be a barometer of sentiment in the market, he said.
Expectations remain in place that the PBOC will step up necessary liquidity support for the economy, given persisting deflationary pressures and Beijing’s growth ambition in a year of escalating trade tensions with the US. The timing of any bold monetary stimulus remains uncertain amid risks to the yuan.
The Chinese central bank has refrained from lowering interest rate or banks’ required reserve ratio since September last year. It has also paused on buying of government bonds in the first two months this year. Some local fund houses are seeing benchmark debt yield testing 2%, should there be further delays in RRR cut.
China’s annual debt supply of new government bonds is set to increase to 11.86 trillion yuan this year, after officials raised the general budget deficit target to around 4% of GDP, the highest level in more than three decades.

Jamie Dimon says it's only 'people in the middle' complaining a lot about RTO,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jamie-dimon-says-only-people-044053287.html,"Who's the biggest proponent of remote work? Jamie Dimon says he knows.
The JPMorgan Chase CEO says it's only ""people in the middle who complain a lot about it.""
The bank announced in January that it's mandating employees return to the office five days a week.
Jamie Dimon says when it comes to RTO pushback, the usual culprits are ""the people in the middle.""
The JPMorgan Chase CEO talked about the bank's return-to-office mandate in a recent interview at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
""If you work in a restaurant, you got to be in. You all may not know this, but 60% of Americans worked the whole time,"" he said, likely referring to the pandemic. ""Where did you get your Amazon packages from? Your beef, your meat, your vodka? Where did you get the diapers from?""
Dimon, whose heated criticisms of remote work have made him a champion of the return to office culture shift, seemed to be talking about people who worked in-person during the pandemic.
""You got UPS and FedEx and manufacturers and agriculture and hospitals and cities and schools and nurses and sanitation and firemen and military. They all worked,"" he continued. ""It's only these people in the middle who complain a lot about it.""
White-collar workers, who generally have more freedom in where their work can be performed than frontline workers, have had various responses to return-to-office mandates in recent years. Some have pushed back or questioned such mandates or even quit over them.
JPMorgan Chase announced in January that it's mandating employees return to the office 5 days a week, starting in March.
Dimon has said he understands enforcing RTO might drive some employees to quit but says he's okay with that.
""I completely respect people that don't want to go to the office all five days a week. That's your right. It's my right. It's a citizen's right,"" he previously told CNBC. ""But they should respect that the company is going to decide what's good for the clients, the company, etc., not an individual.""
Dimon also said one reason he wants people back in the office is that ""younger people are being left behind."" He added that ""to have the younger people coming in but not their bosses, I have a problem with that too.""
JPMorgan Chase did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

"Japan's economy grew at a 2.2% annual rate in Oct-Dec, as consumers held back on spending",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japans-economy-grew-2-2-043503615.html,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s has cut its estimate for its economic growth in the last quarter of the year to a 2.2% annual pace from 2.8% as consumer spending hit demand.
The Cabinet Office said Tuesday that Japan’s real gross domestic product, which measures the sum value of a nation’s goods and services, also was lower due to higher private inventories than earlier reported.
It was the third straight quarter of expansion, and the government maintains that the economy is moderately recovering. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, seasonally adjusted real GDP grew 0.6%, revised from 0.7%. Private demand shrank 0.3%, worse than the 0.1% given earlier. Exports grew 1.0%, instead of the earlier 1.1%.
Unlike the U.S. and some other nations, Japan has been dogged by deflation, and these lower prices stifle growth. But recent wage growth has kept deflationary trends in check.
The slower growth than expected complicates policymaking for the Bank of Japan, which has been expected to raise interest rates. Annual negotiations between labor and management are resulting in bigger wage increases and the central bank has said it will raise its benchmark rate if the economy holds up and prices continue to rise at the projected steady rate of 2%.
The government kept unchanged its finding that the Japanese economy grew at a meager 0.1% annual rate, the fourth straight year of expansion.
The outlook for Japan is clouded by uncertainties about the future course for the U.S. economy and policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, especially tariffs. Japanese companies rely heavily on foreign trade, and tariffs on Japanese exports as well as those of China and other neighboring Asian nations, as well as Mexico and Canada, would reverberate across the globe.
Trade minister Yoji Muto was visiting Washington on Monday in an effort to avert higher tariffs on Japanese exports of steel and aluminum, among other products.
Muto was relaying concerns to U.S. officials that higher tariffs will hurt both Japanese and American businesses, investments and jobs, according to the ministry.

Nvidia's 30% sell-off makes it cheaper than when ChatGPT launched — at least by one metric,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-30-sell-off-makes-043210967.html,"Nvidia's price-to-earnings ratio is now lower than when ChatGPT launched in 2022.
The decline comes amid a broad decline in semiconductor stocks. Nvidia shares are down 30% from their 52-week high.
Melius Research remains optimistic on Nvidia ahead of its conference next week.
A closely watched valuation indicator for Nvidia has fallen to levels not seen since before the launch of ChatGPT.
Nvidia's trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio dropped to 36.4 times on Monday, according to data from YCharts. The decline has been driven by a sharp price decline in Nvidia's stock, which finished Monday down 30% from its intraday record high reached in early January.
The valuation multiple decline makes Nvidia cheaper today than it was when ChatGPT was first released on November 30, 2022. The stock is trading at its cheapest level since August 2019.
Ben Reitzes, managing director at Melius Research, said the valuation dynamic for Nvidia also holds true on a forward P/E ratio, which incorporates Wall Street's year-ahead earnings estimates for the company.
According to Reitzes, with a forward P/E ratio of 24 times, Nvidia stock is 41% cheaper than it was when ChatGPT launched.
It's an impressive feat given that Nvidia shares have soared 583% since OpenAI released ChatGPT to the masses.
In this case, the stock-price surge was backed up by profits, as Nvidia's GPU business boomed due to strong demand from AI companies. Nvidia's net income in the fiscal year 2025 soared 788% compared to the fiscal year 2023, which ended in January 2023.
Reitzes believes there's a valuation disconnect and said in a note on Monday that the risks have largely priced into semiconductor stocks like Nvidia.
""We remain very optimistic,"" Reitzes said.
Part of the optimism stems from Nvidia's GPU Technology Conference next week, where CEO Jensen Huang is expected to assure investors that the AI boom remains alive and well and unveil its product roadmap into 2027, according to Reitzes.
Another reason Reitzes is staying bullish on Nvidia is because he's seen this valuation compression play out before in shares of a technology stalwart: Apple.
""A similar thing happened to Apple actually a long time ago, when its forward multiple went from 33 times on the day it announced the iPhone in 2008 and shrank to 15 times by the end of 2008 in the crisis,"" Reitzes said.
""As you know, the mobile trend didn't end then — and Apple now trades at 31x earnings on much larger numbers. If Nvidia duplicates its own version of this industry stewardship, we could look back at this period of uncertainty and have a good chuckle,"" he added.
Melius Research rates Nvidia at ""Buy"" with a $170 price target, representing potential upside of 60% from current levels.

Ex-Philippine Leader Duterte Arrested in Drug War Case,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-philippine-leader-duterte-arrested-042609592.html,"(Bloomberg) -- The Philippines said former President Rodrigo Duterte is under police custody after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant following an investigation into his deadly drug war.

Duterte was arrested by police at the Manila airport shortly after his arrival on Tuesday from Hong Kong, where he addressed supporters only days earlier. Interpol Manila received a copy of the arrest warrant from the ICC, according to a statement from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s communications office.
“Upon his arrival, the Prosecutor General served the ICC notification for an arrest warrant for the former president for crimes against humanity,” the statement said. Duterte is in good health and was examined by government doctors, it said.
Duterte’s anti-narcotics campaign during his 2016-2022 presidency killed more than 6,000 people, according to government data. Human rights groups estimate the death toll to have been higher, mostly among the poor. He is the father of incumbent Vice President Sara Duterte.
The 79-year-old former president’s legal team is considering asking for hospital detention, ABS-CBN News reported, citing former Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello, who will be the former president’s legal counsel. Duterte is scheduled for a medical check-up tomorrow, Bello was quoted as saying.
Philippine stocks fell, with the key index losing 3%, the most among Asian equity gauges, though analysts linked it to the global selloff. The peso was up 0.1% against the dollar.
The Philippines under Marcos initially cut contact with the ICC after it denied the government’s request to suspend the probe into Duterte. Relations have since soured between the Marcos and Duterte camps with key midterm elections set to be held in May, and officials had signaled there are avenues to cooperate.
Sara Duterte was impeached by Marcos’ allies in the House of Representatives last month on charges she plotted to kill Marcos and misused public funds — accusations she denies. A Senate trial, which would determine if she will be removed from office, is scheduled to begin in July.
Her father had planned to run for mayor of Davao City on the southern island of Mindanao in the midterm election, seeking to reclaim a post that gave him national prominence for endorsing a shoot-to-kill style crackdown on crime.
Rodrigo Duterte said this week he’s ready to go to jail if the ICC orders his arrest. He has also defended his legacy-defining drug war, telling supporters at a stadium in Hong Kong that he did it for them and their children.
“If that’s my fate, that’s fine I will accept it. We can’t do anything if I’m arrested or imprisoned,” he said before a crowd of Filipino supporters on Sunday at a stadium in Hong Kong, according to a video posted on Facebook by broadcaster Bombo Radyo.

Japan’s Finance Minister Says Higher Yields Aren’t All Bad,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/japan-finance-minister-says-higher-042358950.html,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s rising bond yields will have both positive and negative effects on the economy, the nation’s finance minister said Tuesday in a comment likely aimed at easing recent market concern over higher borrowing costs.

While the yield on 10-year government debt fell Tuesday amid global market concerns over the economic outlook, that move came after it hit a 17-year high of 1.575% on Monday.
“Higher yields will impact the economy in multiple ways,” Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters. While interest payments will rise for issuers, interest received will increase for buyers, he added.
Kato was likely trying to play down recent concerns over the upward trajectory of yields. His remarks indicate that the government isn’t only looking at rising yields with concern over the implications for how they might ramp up debt-servicing costs or cool economic activity.
The finance minister spoke a day after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that the government “will ensure thorough preparations” to guard against a sharp rise in long-term yields. Ishiba’s comment suggested heightened government concern over the recent gains.
The implications of higher interest rates are particularly acute for Japan given its high debt load. The International Monetary Fund estimates the nation’s public debt at around 233% of gross domestic product this year. Servicing Japan’s oversized debt is already expected to chew up close to a quarter of the annual budget for the year starting in April.
For many years the BOJ manipulated long-term bond yields to keep them around zero as part of its efforts to generate an inflation cycle that sparks stronger growth. Last year the central bank scrapped its control of yields and committed itself to paring back its purchases, thereby removing a ceiling on yields and allowing the market to determine pricing.
The BOJ still says it will step in if there are sharp moves in yields, but it remains unclear what scale of change would trigger action, creating uncertainty among traders of Japanese government bonds. While the central bank is legally independent from the government they are both committed to the achievement of sustained growth and stable inflation through a 2013 joint accord.
Core inflation in Japan is now approaching three years at or above the BOJ’s target. So after years of subzero interest rates, the direction of Japanese borrowing costs is on an upward path, even as central banks elsewhere in the world mull the timing of their next rate cuts.
Kato touched on the need to maintain steady demand for Japanese government debt to avoid sharp fluctuations in pricing in the wake of the BOJ’s stepping back in the market.
“As a bond-issuing authority, I think it’s important to aim for stable sales of government bonds,” he said.

US private funds ask SEC to rethink Gensler-era rules,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-private-funds-ask-sec-041028125.html,"By Carolina Mandl
NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Managed Funds Association, a private fund industry group, has urged the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) to reform or withdraw regulations introduced over the past four years.
The recommendations, including changes to mandates involving Treasury trades and funds' disclosures, were made in a letter to acting chair Mark Uyeda, President Donald Trump's pick for the position.
The MFA said its 10 recommendations would ""reduce costs and burdens on market participants and improve the efficiency of the financial markets.""
The MFA's moves come as private fund associations have challenged in court to overturn new rules the SEC adopted in 2023 under chair Gary Gensler, with the groups scoring some victories.
The industry recommended the regulator help improve market infrastructure before implementing a key reform introduced by the SEC in 2023 aimed at reducing systemic risk in the $28.5 trillion Treasuries market by forcing more trades through clearing houses.
Last month, Wall Street's top regulator delayed by a year the rollout of the new rules for some cash and repo Treasury transactions, agreeing with requests made by trade associations. The rules would initially be implemented in phases by June 2026.
Although MFA did not mention a specific new deadline, it said the SEC should only require Treasury clearing when the market infrastructure is in place, such as greater access to central clearing and cross-margining.
The fund industry group also asked the SEC to review an update of the ""Form PF rule"" from 2023 requiring funds to disclose more information, such as events that may indicate significant stress or otherwise signal the potential for systemic risk and investor harm, including significant margin calls or counterparty defaults, within 72 hours of the event.
While the private fund industry is in litigation with the SEC and awaits a court decision to vacate two other rules aimed at boosting transparency of short selling and securities lending, the MFA has asked the SEC to reduce the amount of information reported. When investors short a stock, they profit if its price falls.
Additionally, the MFA has asked the SEC to take steps to create a framework to govern digital asset securities and to ensure that private funds can invest in them without breaching custody requirements.
