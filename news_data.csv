Make room Starbucks and McDonald's. China's Mixue and other brands win fans in Southeast Asia,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/room-starbucks-mcdonalds-chinas-mixue-021303147.html,"Oops, something went wrong
HONG KONG (AP) — Chinese food and beverage brands are gaining ground across Southeast Asia, offering alternatives to big name American chains and expanding Beijing’s commercial and cultural influence in neighboring economies.
The Chinese beverage giant Mixue Group has become the world’s largest F&B chain by number of outlets, overtaking Starbucks and McDonald’s.
The company, whose brand name Mixue Bingcheng means “Honey Snow Ice City,” in Chinese, is capitalizing on the region-wide sweet tooth with affordable offerings of ice cream, coffee and bubble tea drinks.
“Even on social media like TikTok and others, there is a joke that any empty shophouse would soon turn into a Mixue store,” Rahma Yuliana said, referring to a popular saying in Indonesia, where Mixue has more than 2,600 outlets.
The single mother, who runs an online business, takes her daughter for afterschool treats that won't drain her wallet, such as a cup of brown sugar milk tea that costs $1.10, about one-third cheaper than similar offerings by rival Taiwanese tea chain Chatime. An ice cream sells for as little as 50 cents, undercutting McDonald’s.
As of September, Mixue Group had over 45,000 stores carrying its Mixue tea drinks, ice creams and Lucky Cup coffee products, more than the store numbers of Starbucks and McDonald’s, industry analysts reported. About 40,000 of those are in China.
More broadly, by December, Chinese F&B brands had opened over 6,100 outlets in Southeast Asia, Singapore-headquartered research firm Momentum Works reported. India and Vietnam account for roughly two-thirds, while there are relatively more Chinese brands in Singapore and Malaysia, which have sizable Chinese-speaking populations.
Nearly all of Mixue's stores are franchises that the company supplies with ingredients for drinks like Creamy Mango Boba, Mango Oats Jasmine Tea and Coconut Jelly Milk Tea.
Apart from Mixue, other market stars include hotpot giant Haidilao, Fish With You sauerkraut fish restaurants, and well-known beverage brands such as Luckin Coffee, Heytea and Chagee.
Mixue's shares have doubled from their IPO price since their March 3 trading debut in Hong Kong.
Momentum Works CEO Jianggan Li said Chinese businesses are actively seeking new growth in Southeast Asia after facing fierce competition in their home market.
The push by food and drink retailers has raised awareness that China has more to offer than just cheap electronics.
The companies are well-equipped, using automation to enhance their efficiency, and adept at online marketing, Li said. Big Western brands sometimes take a long time to find local partners and develop long-term plans. The Chinese F&B companies are “much more impatient,"" he said.
In Thailand’s capital Bangkok, Chinese entrepreneur Siya Han has invested over $1.37 million in 12 Mixue stores and about 10 other outlets selling spicy broth bowls, sauerkraut fish and fried chicken steaks in about six years. Outlets in shopping malls take time to recover costs due to huge rent deposits, she said, but her other outlets typically break even within six months to a year, excluding their lease guarantees.
“If you open Chinese restaurants slowly, you can't survive,” she said.
In the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, Chinese sauerkraut fish chain Fish With You vice president Liu Liujun also spotted opportunity in Southeast Asia’s large ethnic Chinese population and growing economies.
The brand’s $235,000 investment in one of its Malaysian outlets paid off in just nine months, with lines out the door almost daily, said Liu, who oversees the company's overseas expansion across the region.
A customer, Victoria Kovalan said the new Chinese brands made it easier for her to try new cuisines. “It’s opened up our palates,” she said, referring to the popularity of Sichuan hotpots, known for their spicy flavors.
Vietnamese student Nguyen Thu Hoài in Hanoi initially was skeptical about Mixue as a Chinese brand but has become a regular customer, she said, won over by its affordability and better-than-expected quality.
The expansion of Chinese food and beverage brands is part of a broader trend where Chinese goods are no longer seen as merely cheap but as having real value, said Gordon Mathews, a professor of anthropology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Recalling the cultural influence from McDonald’s global expansion, Mathews said he visited its first outlet in southern China’s economic hub of Guangzhou in the 1990s, where a clerk told him, “I want to go to America.”
If Chinese food brands exploded worldwide, they might have that influence, though the impact remains to be seen, he said.
“China does have an uphill struggle to obtain soft power, but it’s doing an excellent job with its products,” he said.

A government shutdown now seems unlikely. That's giving the stock market a much-needed boost.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/government-shutdown-now-seems-unlikely-234854695.html,"Oops, something went wrong
The US stock market rallied on Friday after days of pain brought on by Trump's trade war.
Markets cheered after Sen. Chuck Schumer said he'd support a GOP spending bill.
It means a government shutdown will likely be averted, delivering investors much-needed good news.
After days of pain brought on by President Donald Trump's trade war, markets got some relief in Friday's session as developments in Washington, DC, indicated the government will avoid a shutdown.
Major stock averages rose sharply on the unexpected news that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer would support the six-month stopgap bill from Republicans. The benchmark S&P 500 increased as much as 2% on Friday, with the biggest gains coming in the afternoon. It helped claw back some of the week's losses, although the benchmark is still down 2.5% over the past five days.
The Nasdaq jumped as much as 2.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked with a nearly-700-point gain.
Here's where the market stood around 1:30 a.m. ET Friday:
S&P 500: 5,620.97, up 1.8%
Dow Jones Industrial Average: 41,416.27, up 1.5% (603 points)
Nasdaq Composite: 17,684.32, up 2.2%
Though Schumer pledged to oppose the bill earlier in the week, signaling the Democrats would opt for a shutdown, he ultimately conceded that his party would wield no control in such a scenario.
""The total off-ramp of a shutdown, how you stop a shutdown, is totally determined by the Republican House and Senate, and that is totally determined because they've shown complete, blind obeisance [to] Trump, DOGE, etc. They could keep us in a shutdown for months and months and months,"" he told reporters.
While the move has angered some fellow Democrats who were ready to oppose the spending bill, investors cheered Schumer's about-face as it removed a layer of uncertainty in what's been a trying week for markets.
The exuberance was enough for markets to sidestep fresh signs of consumer weakness. Friday's consumer sentiment report was the lowest reading since 2022, with US consumers facing tariff uncertainty and inflation fears.
A barrage of tariff news this week crushed investor confidence and sent volatility soaring. The S&P 500 ended Thursday's session in a correction, down 10% from its February 19 high.
At the same time, gold reached a record high of $3,000 an ounce on Friday, while Treasury yields have dropped in an investor flight to safety.
Even with markets in retreat, the Trump White House has remained unfazed. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the administration isn't worried about a ""little bit of volatility,"" and the focus is on the broader economy.

"The list of major companies laying off staff this year, including Porsche, Wayfair, Starbucks, and Meta",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/full-list-major-us-companies-220813398.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Companies such as Meta, Microsoft, BlackRock, and Chevron are conducting layoffs.
Artificial intelligence is reshaping some workforces.
See the list of companies letting workers go in 2025.
Layoffs and other workforce reductions are continuing in 2025, following two years of significant job cuts across tech, media, finance, manufacturing, retail, and energy.
While the reasons for slimming staff vary, the cost-cutting measures are coming amid a backdrop of technological change. In a recent World Economic Forum survey, some 41% of companies worldwide said they expected to reduce their workforces over the next five years because of the rise of artificial intelligence.
Companies such as CNN, Dropbox, and IBM have previously announced job cuts related to AI. Tech jobs in big data, fintech, and AI are meanwhile expected to double by 2030, according to the WEF.
Here are the companies with job cuts planned or already underway in 2025 so far.
Adidas plans to cut up to 500 jobs in Germany.
Adidas said in January that it would reduce the size of its workforce at its headquarters in Herzogenaurach, Germany, impacting up to 500 jobs, CNBC reported.
If fully executed, it amounts to a reduction of nearly 9% at the company headquarters, which employs about 5,800 employees, according to the Adidas website.
The news came shortly after the company announced it had outperformed its profit expectations at the end of 2024, touting ""better-than-expected"" results in the fourth quarter.
""Strong growth across all regions and divisions proves the good job our teams are doing across regions and functions,"" CEO Bjørn Gulden said in a press release. ""So although we are not yet where we want to be long term, I am very happy with this development which was much better than we had expected.""
In a statement to BI, an Adidas spokesperson said the company had grown ""too complex because of our current operating model.""
""To set adidas up for long-term success,"" the spokesperson said, ""we are now starting to look at how we align our operating model with the reality of how we work. This may have an impact on the organizational structure and number of roles based at our HQ in Herzogenaurach.""
The company said it is not a cost-cutting measure and that it could not confirm concrete numbers.
Ally is cutting less than 5% of workers.
The digital-financial-services company Ally is laying off roughly 500 of its 11,000 employees, a spokesperson confirmed to BI.
""As we continue to right-size our company, we made the difficult decision to selectively reduce our workforce in some areas, while continuing to hire in our other areas of our business,"" the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson also said the company was offering severance, out-placement support, and the opportunity to apply for openings at Ally.
Ally made a similar level of cuts in October 2023, the Charlotte Observer reported.
BlackRock is cutting 1% of its workforce.
BlackRock told employees it was planning to cut about 200 people of its 21,000-strong workforce, Bloomberg reported in January.
The reductions were more than offset by some 3,750 workers who were added last year and another 2,000 expected to be added in 2025.
BlackRock's president, Rob Kapito, and its chief operating officer, Rob Goldstein, said the cuts would help realign the firm's resources with its strategy, Bloomberg reported.
Blue Origin
Jeff Bezos's rocket company, Blue Origin, is laying off about 10% of its workforce, a move that could affect more than 1,000 employees.
In a memo sent to staff in February and obtained by Business Insider, David Limp, the CEO of Blue Origin, said the company's priority going forward was ""to scale our manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness and efficiency for our customers.""
Limp specifically identified roles in engineering, research and development, and management as targets.
""We grew and hired incredibly fast in the last few years, and with that growth came more bureaucracy and less focus than we needed,"" Limp wrote. ""It also became clear that the makeup of our organization must change to ensure our roles are best aligned with executing these priorities.""
The news comes after last month's debut launch of the company's partially reusable rocket — New Glenn.
Boeing cut 400 roles from its moon rocket program
Boeing announced on February 8 it plans to cut 400 roles from its moon rocket program amid delays and rising costs related to NASA's Artemis moon exploration missions.
Artemis 2, a crewed flight to orbit the moon on Boeing's space launch system, has been re-scheduled from late 2024 to September 2025. Artemis 3, intended to be the first astronaut moon landing in the program, was delayed from late 2025 and is now planned for September 2026.
""To align with revisions to the Artemis program and cost expectations, we informed our Space Launch Systems team of the potential for approximately 400 fewer positions by April 2025,"" a Boeing spokesperson told Business Insider. ""We are working with our customer and seeking opportunities to redeploy employees across our company to minimize job losses and retain our talented teammates.""
The company will issue 60-day notices of involuntary layoff to impacted employees ""in coming weeks,"" the spokesperson said earlier this month.
Boeing cut 10% of its workforce last year.
BP slashed 7,700 staff and contractor positions worldwide.
BP told Business Insider in January that it planned to cut 4,700 staff and 3,000 contractors, amounting to about 5% of its global workforce.
The cuts were part of a program to ""simplify and focus"" BP that began last year.
""We are strengthening our competitiveness and building in resilience as we lower our costs, drive performance improvement and play to our distinctive capabilities,"" the company said.
Bridgewater cut about 90 staff.
Bridgewater Associates cut 7% of its staff in January in an effort to stay lean, a person familiar with the matter told Business Insider.
The layoffs at the world's largest hedge fund bring its head count back to where it was in 2023, the person said.
The company's founder, Ray Dalio, said in a 2019 interview that about 30% of new employees were leaving the firm within 18 months.
Chevron is slashing up to 20% of its global headcount
Oil giant Chevron plans to cull 15% to 20% of its global workforce by the end of 2026, the company said in a statement to Business Insider in February.
Chevron employed 45,600 people as of December 2023, which means the layoff could cut 9,000 jobs.
The move aims to reduce costs and simplify the company's business as it completes its acquisition of oil producer Hess, which is held up in legal limbo. It is expected to save the company $2 billion to $3 billion by the end of 2026, the company said.
""Chevron is taking action to simplify our organizational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness,"" a Chevron spokesperson said in a statement.
The cuts follow a series of layoffs at other oil and gas companies, including BP and natural gas producer EQT.
CNN plans to cut 200 jobs.
Cable news giant CNN cut about 200 television-focused roles as part of a digital pivot. The cuts amounted to about 6% of the company's workforce.
In a memo sent to staff on January 23, CNN's CEO Mark Thompson said he aimed to ""shift CNN's gravity towards the platforms and products where the audience themselves are shifting and, by doing that, to secure CNN's future as one of the world's greatest news organizations.""
Estée Lauder will cut as many as 7,000 jobs
Cosmetics giant Estée Lauder said in its second-quarter earnings release on February 4 that it will cut between 5,800 and 7,000 jobs as the company restructures over the next two years.
The cuts will focus on ""rightsizing"" certain teams, and it will look to outsource certain services. The company says it expects annual gross benefits of between $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion before tax.
HPE is laying off 2,500 employees
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is cutting 2,500 jobs, or 5% of its employee base, CEO Antonio Neri said on an earnings call on March 6. The cuts are expected take to take place over the next 12 to 18 months.
""Doing so will better align our cost structure to our business mix and long-term strategy,"" Neri said. The company expects to save $350 million by 2027 because of the reduction.
HPE plummeted about 20% after hours on March 6 after it said business would be affected by recent tariffs, slow server and cloud sales, and ""execution issues.""
Johns Hopkins
Johns Hopkins University will cut over 2,000 jobs after losing $800 million in funding from USAID.
""This is a difficult day for our entire community,"" a spokesperson told BI. ""The termination of more than $800 million in USAID funding is now forcing us to wind down critical work here in Baltimore and internationally.""
The news comes after the Trump administration slashed USAID personnel down from over 10,000 to around 300. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently confirmed that 83% of the agency's programs are now dead.
""We can confirm that the elimination of foreign aid funding has led to the loss of 1,975 positions in 44 countries internationally and 247 in the United States in the affected programs,"" the Johns Hopkins spokesperson said. ""An additional 29 international and 78 domestic employees will be furloughed with a reduced schedule.""
The layoffs at Johns Hopkins represent the ""largest"" in the University's history, CNN reported. They'll primarily affect the schools of medicine and public health, along with the Center for Communication Programs and Jhpiego, a nonprofit with a focus on preventing diseases and bolstering women's health, according to the report.
Kohl's is reducing about 10% of its roles
Department store Kohl's announced on January 28 that it reduced about 10% of its corporate roles to ""increase efficiencies"" and ""improve profitability for the long-term health and benefit of the business,"" a spokesperson told BI.
""Kohl's reduced approximately 10 percent of the roles that report into its corporate offices,"" the spokesperson said. ""More than half of the total reduction will come from closing open positions while the remainder of the positions were currently held by our associates.""
Less than 200 existing employees of the company would be impacted, she added.
This follows the company's announcement on January 9 that it would shutter 27 underperforming stores across 15 states by April.
The retailer has been struggling with declining sales, reporting an 8.8% decline in net sales in the third quarter of 2024.
Its previous CEO, Tom Kingsbury, stepped down on January 15. The company's board appointed Ashley Buchanan, a retail veteran who had held top jobs in The Michaels Companies, Macy's, and Walmart, as the new CEO.
Meta is cutting 5% of its workforce.
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told staff he ""decided to raise the bar on performance management"" and will act quickly to ""move out low-performers,"" according to an internal memo seen by BI in January.
Those cuts started this month, according to records obtained by BI. Teams overseeing Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, as well as logistics were among the hardest hit.
Previously, the company had laid off more than 21,000 workers since 2022.
Microchip Technology is slashing 2,000 jobs
Microchip Technology is cutting its head count across the company by around 2,000 employees, the semiconductor company said on March 3.
The company estimated that it would incur between $30 million and $40 million in costs, including severance, severance benefits, and other restructuring costs.
The cuts would be communicated to employees in the March quarter and fully implemented by the end of the June quarter.
Last year, Microchip announced it was closing its Tempe, Arizona, facility because of slower-than-anticipated orders. The closure begins in May 2025 and is expected to affect 500 jobs.
Microchip's stock had fallen over 33% in the past year.
Microsoft made performance-based job cuts in January
Microsoft cut an unspecified number of jobs in January based on employees' performance.
Workers were told that they wouldn't receive severance and that their benefits, such as medical insurance, would stop immediately, BI reported.
The company also laid off some employees in January at divisions including gaming and sales. A Microsoft spokesperson declined to say how many jobs were cut on the affected teams.
Porsche is cutting 3,900 jobs over the next few years
Porsche said on March 12 that it plans to cut 3,900 jobs in the coming years.
About 2,000 of the reductions will come with the expiration of fixed-term contractor positions, the German automaker said Wednesday. The company will make the other 1,900 reductions by 2029 through natural attrition and limiting hiring, it said.
Porsche said it also plans to discuss more potential changes with labor leaders in the second half of the year. ""This will also make Porsche even more efficient in the medium and long term,"" the company said.
Salesforce is cutting more than 1,000 jobs
Bloomberg reported in February that Salesforce, a cloud-based customer management software company, will slash more than 1,000 jobs from its nearly 73,000-strong workforce.
Affected employees will be eligible to apply to open internal roles, the outlet reported. The company is currently hiring salespeople focused on the company's new AI-powered products.
The cuts come despite Salesforce reporting a strong financial performance during its third-quarter earnings in December.
Representatives for Salesforce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
Sonos cuts about 200 jobs
Sonos, a California-based audio equipment company, said in a February 5 release that it's cutting about 200 roles.
The announcement came nearly a month after Sonos CEO Patrick Spence stepped down from his position following a disastrous app rollout. The company's interim CEO Tom Conrad said in the statement that the layoff was part of an effort to create a ""simpler organization.""
""One thing I've observed first hand is that we've become mired in too many layers that have made collaboration and decision-making harder than it needs to be,"" Conrad said. ""So across the company today we are reorganizing into flatter, smaller, and more focused teams.""
Southwest Airlines
Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan announced in February that the company is laying off 15% of its corporate staff, or about 1,750 employees.
He said impacted workers will keep their pay, benefits, and bonuses through late April, when the separations will take effect.
The company told investors the cuts would provide a ""partial year 2025 savings to be approximately $210 million and full-year 2026 savings to be approximately $300 million.""
The move comes as Southwest tries to cut costs amid profitability problems. Jordan said this is the first significant layoff the company has had in its 53-year history.
An activist hedge fund took a stake in Southwest in June and has since helped restructure its board and change its business model to keep up with a changing industry. For example, it plans to end its long-standing open-seating policy to generate more seating revenue.
In recent months, the company has also reduced flight crew positions in Atlanta to cut costs.
Starbucks is laying off 1,100 corporate staff.
Starbucks will notify 1,100 corporate employees that they have been laid off on February 25.
CEO Brian Niccol said in a memo that the layoffs will make Starbucks ""operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration.""
The layoffs won't affect employees at Starbucks stores, the company said.
Niccol told employees that layoffs were on the way in a separate memo in January. The company is trying to improve results after sales slid last year.
Stripe laid off 300 employees.
Payments platform Stripe laid off 300 employees, primarily in product, engineering, and operations, according to a January 20 memo obtained by BI.
Chief People Officer Rob McIntosh said in the memo that the company still planned on growing its head count to about 10,000 employees by the end of the year.
The Washington Post cut 4% of its non-newsroom workforce.
The Washington Post eliminated less than 100 employees in an effort to cut costs, Reuters reported in January.
A spokesperson told the wire service that the changes would occur across multiple areas of the business and indicated that the cuts wouldn't affect the newsroom.
""The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry, build a more sustainable future and reach audiences where they are,"" the spokesperson said, according to Reuters.
Wayfair laid off 340 tech employees
Wayfair announced in an SEC filing on March 7 that it would eliminate its Austin Technology Development Center and lay off around 340 tech workers.
The reorg comes as the technology team has accomplished ""significant modernization and replatforming milestones,"" the company said in the filing. Wayfair said it plans to refocus resources and streamline operations to promote its ""next phase of growth.""
""With the foundation of this transformation now in place, our technology needs have shifted,"" the company said.
Wayfair expects to take on $33 to $38 million in costs as a result of the reorganization, consisting of severance, cash employee-related costs, benefits, and transitional costs.
Workday cut more than 8% of its workforce
Workday, the human-resources software company, said in February that it is cutting 8.5% of its workforce, or around 1,750 employees. The layoffs came as the company focuses more on artificial intelligence.
In a note to employees, CEO Carl Eschenbach said that Workday will focus on hiring in areas related to artificial intelligence and work to expand its global presence.
""The environment we're operating in today demands a new approach, particularly given our size and scale,"" Eschenbach wrote. He said that affected employees will get at least 12 weeks of pay.

Here's what could go right for stocks after a brutal tariff-fueled wipeout,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-could-stocks-brutal-tariff-233732765.html,"Oops, something went wrong
The stock market has been hammered by tariff worries but a handful of catalysts could spark a turnaround.
The stock market has been badly hurt by President Donald Trump's trade war so far, but one Wall Street research firm says there are potential catalysts on the horizon that could help turn the situation around for investors.
Strategists at BCA Research said they see a handful of ""upside scenarios"" that could restart the rally. Though the scenarios may all be longshots, they're all plausible — and could lead to the major indexes climbing back to all-time-highs, Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist at the firm, said.
The call is notable coming from BCA, which has called for a recession in 2025 and has one the lowest price targets for the S&P 500 on Wall Street this year.
""We continue to maintain a bearish view on equities on the grounds that the US will likely enter a recession this year,"" Berezin said. ""All that said, despite our bearish predisposition towards stocks, we are open-minded to anything that could challenge our thesis.""
Here are five things the firm thinks could spark a turnaround for the market.
Trump used the stock market to gauge the success of his presidency during his first term, though he's less focused on the market now. However, the president could be disciplined by markets and soften his trade policy as the decline in stocks becomes too steep to ignore.
That dynamic hasn't played out so far. Berezin pointed to instances where Trump's team has communicated that the president is no longer using the stock market as a barometer for his success.
Last weekend, Trump also acknowledged that the economy was going through a ""period of transition"" after his latest round of tariffs, which suggested to markets that the president is okay with some volatility for now. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated the administration's view that it will tolerate market volatility as it pursues its policy goals.
""Our strong suspicion is that the tolerance among Americans for economic pain is very low, especially in the case where the pain seems self-inflicted. This suggests that Trump will back down,"" Berezin said.
Markets have been concerned that bond investors could stage a big sell-off in a revolt against Trump's plan to extend his 2017 tax cuts. That would send yields spiking toward a level that could hurt stocks.
There's a chance that doesn't happen though, which would be positive for equities, BCA Research said.
The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond, an indicator of long-term interest rate expectations in the economy, spiked as high as 4.8% in early January — one sign that investors anticipated less demand for the US debt, which could be due to concerns about an unsustainable fiscal situation.
Yields have since declined, a sign that those worries have abated for now. The 10-year yield traded around 4.3% on Friday.
""Investors should monitor Treasury term premia to gauge whether risk premia on bonds are rising to dangerous levels. So far, that has not happened,"" Berezin said.
Fiscal stimulus and structural reforms in Europe could end up boosting growth abroad — something that could be a positive for US markets as well.
""There is significant scope for gains from knocking down internal barriers to trade. This is true in the European Union. It is also true in countries such as Canada,"" Berezin said, pointing to estimates that removing trade barriers impacting Canada could raise GDP by as much as 8% in the nation.
European stocks have already done well so far this year. The EURO STOXX 50 Index is up 9% since the start of January, outperforming the S&P 500, which is down 5% year-to-date.
Oil prices are already depressed but they could fall further as a result of Trump's plan to boost US energy production. When prices slump as the result of increased supply, that has traditionally been a positive signal for stocks, Berezin said.
Things already look positive on the production side. OPEC+ has said it would wind back some of its production curbs starting in April of this year, and Trump, who declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office, has said he would pour more resources into US energy infrastructure.
Oil prices have declined since the start of the year. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $70 a barrel on Friday, down from a peak of $82 a barrel earlier in the year.
AI could end up boosting productivity way more than expected, which would be be a boon for the US economy and markets, the firm said.
BCA Research estimated that growth could scale anywhere from 30 to 100 times as a result of AI. That's similar to what the US economy saw during the agricultural and industrial revolutions, it noted.
Still, the firm noted that productivity gains could take a while to show up in the economy. And while the US is in the midst of an AI investment boom, there are depreciating returns on those investments, which could pose a risk to investors.

Washington has averted a government shutdown,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/washington-has-averted-a-government-shutdown-211236090.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Washington averted a government shutdown after an up-and-down week saw House Republicans offering a united front and resistant Democrats cornered.
The key moment on Friday was an early evening procedural vote in the US Senate that ended debate on a continuing resolution (CR). The final 62-38 vote included 10 Senate Democratic votes in the affirmative. Their support pushed the count above the required 60-vote threshold.
Democratic-caucusing Sens. Chuck Schumer, Catherine Cortez Masto, Dick Durbin, John Fetterman, Kirsten Gillibrand, Maggie Hassan, Angus King, Gary Peters, Brian Schatz, and Jeanne Shaheen all voted yes. Republican Sen. Rand Paul voted no in what was otherwise a party-line vote.
A final vote then followed later, shortly after 6 p.m., and passed comfortably.
""The CR is a bad bill, but as bad as the CR is, I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option,"" said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer hours before the vote as he announced he would be voting yes.
The spending plan's passage set off another round of Democratic Party agita and soul-searching, with Schumer and other Senate Democrats saying they had no choice but to help push through the 99-page bill written by Republicans.
It will keep the government open until Sept. 30 with GOP priorities attached and little in the way of concessions to Democrats.
The bill is set to offer increased spending on issues like defense and immigration and cuts elsewhere to other programs.
The changes overall are a proverbial drop in the bucket of America's fiscal situation given the country has carried multitrillion-dollar budget deficits in recent years.
""What we're leaving in terms of debt, what the next generation will be inheriting, and at this point it's not just an economic risk, I think it's a huge national security risk,"" Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said Friday in a new episode of Yahoo Finance’s Capitol Gains podcast.
Her group recently pointed out that the US government has already run up $1.1 trillion in new deficit spending in just the first five months of the current fiscal year.
The group also found that this week’s bill will likely have the net fiscal impact of adding $7 billion to the debt in the years ahead, largely because cuts to the IRS will allow more people to avoid paying taxes and drive down collections.
It also doesn’t help that this week’s fight came during a climate of deep economic unease. Stock sell-offs have put markets into a correction at the same time as firms slash S&P 500 year-end targets. Trump's trade war also continues unabated and, so far, the president appears unconcerned about its impact on the economy.
Friday’s votes capped a week of standoffs on Capitol Hill that began with observers estimating a one-in-three chance of a shutdown as House Republicans planned to muscle through their bill with slim margins and plenty of initial skepticism that they could succeed.
Even Trump at the time tossed up his hands and told reporters Sunday about a shutdown: ""It could happen ... you never know.""
But House Speaker Mike Johnson’s gambit worked, with a 217 to 213 vote that advanced the stopgap measure and forced Democrats' hand.
Speaker Johnson saw only one member of his own party, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, oppose the bill and one Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, move to support the GOP plan.
The path to passage in the Senate was always more complicated, and Democratic Leader Schumer briefly spiked shutdown odds midweek when he signaled that Democrats would be opposed.
""Our caucus is unified,"" Schumer said at the time, promising to block the plan and pushing a one-month bill instead. But then the Democratic leader quickly saw his Senate caucus split as many voted no, with others, including Schumer, voting yes in an acknowledgment of the political reality.
For his part, on Friday, Trump offered a perhaps facetious, ""Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing."" He then inadvertently reminded wary markets that plenty of opportunities for government dysfunction lie ahead.
""The big Tax Cuts, L.A. fire fix, Debt Ceiling Bill, and so much more, is coming,"" the president wrote.

"Stock market today: Dow, S&P 500 soar, Nasdaq rebounds in best day since November to cap volatile week",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-dow-sp-500-soar-nasdaq-rebounds-in-best-day-since-november-to-cap-volatile-week-200045291.html,"Oops, something went wrong
US stocks bounced back sharply on Friday to cap a volatile week on Wall Street as the risk of a government shutdown eased while investors stayed on watch for the next move in an escalating trade war.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed more than 2.1% after the benchmark index sank on Thursday to close in correction territory. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped over 2.6% as tech stocks soared. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up more than 600 points, or 1.6%.
Stocks have had a rough week as uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariff shifts whipsawed markets and overshadowed otherwise encouraging signals about the economy. All three major gauges registered weekly losses of more than 2% after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) joined the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) in correction.
It took less than a month for the benchmark index to fall into correction, the fifth-fastest such move in the past 75 years, according to Ritholtz Wealth Management.
But Wall Street spirits brightened as Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer backed off a threat to block a funding bill aimed at averting a government shutdown at the weekend.
At the same time, gold (GC=F) broke above $3,000 an ounce for the first time amid warnings about the economic damage from Trump's tariffs. On Thursday, Trump said he didn't plan to ""bend at all"" in the escalating round of tit-for-tat tariffs with America's biggest trading partners.

Concerns that the US economy is showing signs of strain have receded after data this week showed inflation heading in the direction desired by the Federal Reserve, which holds its policy meeting next week. But the details of that data could give policymakers pause for thought.
It's clear, however, that consumers are feeling less and less enthused about the state of their pocketbooks. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey came in at 57.9 on Friday, well below expectations of 63.
US stocks rebounded sharply to close near the highs of the session on Friday, though all three major averages still finished the week with losses.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) climbed more than 2% after the broad-based index sank on Thursday to close in correction territory. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) had its best day since the day after the election, up 2.6% as tech stocks soared. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed more than 600 points, or 1.6%.
The risk of a government shutdown faded while investors were on alert regarding any further tariff developments from the Trump administration after this week's market action.
Despite Friday's rally, all three major gauges registered weekly losses of more than 2%, with the Dow suffering its worst week since 2023.
With just 20 minutes left of trading on Friday, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was trading near session highs, on pace to see its best day since January. Tech stocks led the gains as all three major averages rebounded to cap a volatile week on Wall Street. However, the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were on track to end the week lower.
All eleven sectors of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) were in green territory during Friday's session with most assets posting gains.
Oil jumped on Friday as prices held relatively steady for the week as traders assessed tariff uncertainty along with continuing efforts to end the Ukraine war.
West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures rose to settle above $67 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark price, rose above $70 per barrel.
On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin indicated Moscow would support a US-led ceasefire in principle, but some issues would need to be discussed.
""Most traders still feel some kind of a peace deal is near which would likely add Russian barrels to the market,"" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote said in a note on Friday.
""Technically WTI April crude remains in a choppy type of trade torn between tariffs weakening global demand and tighter US storage numbers with the beginning of driving season,"" he added.

Tech led the rebound on Friday, but was still on track to end the week with losses. The S&P 500 Tech Sector (XLK) jumped nearly 3% during Friday's session, followed by Energy (XLE), Financials (XLF), and Consumer Discretionary (XLY) as the broader market gained.
Despite Friday's sharp rally, Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Tech stocks were still on track to close out the week with losses as the 5-day chart below shows
Tech stocks rebounded on Friday, leading the Nasdaq to gain more than 2.3% to cap a volatile week on Wall Street.
Nvidia (NVDA) surged more than 5% as the AI chip heavyweight was on track to close out the week with 7% gains.
Meanwhile, the rest of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks gained on Friday but were still headed toward weekly losses.
EV giant Tesla (TSLA) gained more than 3% during the session. Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) also rose more than 2%.
Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) soared over 18% as of midday trading on Friday after the electronic signature company beat earnings and revenue estimates and more customers adopted its artificial intelligence offerings.
As Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi writes, DocuSign's business remained brisk despite rising concerns of an economic growth slowdown in the US.
""As I looked at our February numbers, for example, our transaction volumes were pretty much on target with what we had expected — not seeing any major impact there,"" Thygesen said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief on Friday. ""So at this point, we haven't seen any impact of the recent volatility.""

In a new note to clients published Friday, BMO chief investment strategist Brian Belski — one of the Street's staunchest bulls who was quick to call the market turnaround back in 2022 — argues that the uncertainty and fear of this market moment is no reason to rip up your view on markets and the economy.
""Given the increased negative banter and many macro forecasts being revised to the downside, we have been inundated by clients on not only our opinion, but more directly — why we are NOT changing our view,"" Belski wrote.
In addition to not knowing the process of other firms and arguing that company-specific trends are being extrapolated to the broad market, Belski added: ""Unfortunately, uncertainty generates emotion, which comes from fear. ... To be blunt, we believe it is inappropriate to be changing forecasts for the sake of uncertainty and fear.""
On Thursday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) entered correction territory, defined as a 10% drop from recent highs.
""We know that corrections do not necessarily equate to bear markets,"" Belski added.
More broadly, Belski sees the way the market has acted over the last two years — essentially going up unabated amid AI enthusiasm and riding the wave of a strong economy — as having set us up for the current moment of instability.
Here's Belski, with the money quote on where things stand in his team's mind as we head toward the end of a rough week for markets:
Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose above $83,000 per token on Friday amid an overall market rebound.
The world's largest cryptocurrency has been range-bound over the past week fluctuating between $77,000 and $84,000 as investors reacted to the Trump administration's tariff policies and growing worries of an economic slowdown.
""As the market recovers from the turmoil caused by tariffs and becomes more certain about the direction of trade policy, cryptocurrencies may find themselves in a better place than they were previously,"" Samer Hasn, a senior market analyst at XS.com, said on Friday.

Consumer sentiment tumbled in March, as the impacts of President Trump's tariff policies and elevated prices remain a top concern for Americans.
The latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey released Friday showed sentiment hit its lowest level since November 2022. The index slid to a reading of 57.9, below the 64.7 seen last month and the 63 expected by economists.
Pessimism over the inflation outlook soared again in March as one-year inflation expectations jumped to 4.9% from 4.3% the month prior. Just two months ago, consumers had only expected inflation of 3.3% over the next year.
Long-run inflation expectations, which track expectations over the next five to 10 years, climbed too, hitting 3.9% in March, up from 3.4% in February. This marked the largest month-over-month increase in long-run inflation expectations since 1993.
Tesla (TSLA) shares slumped recently, erasing post-Election Day gains, and closed down nearly 3% Thursday. Tesla warned that retaliatory tariffs could hurt its operations and urged the US to rethink trade policies.

Stocks rebounded on Friday following steep losses in the prior session as the risk of a US government shutdown waned and investors eyed the escalating trade war.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.9% after the index closed in correction territory on Thursday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained more than 1.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%.
Investors are keeping a close eye on the trade war, which has set all three major averages on pace to end the week lower.
Gold is set to be the big winner this week after crossing $3,000 an ounce for the first time. The precious metal is on track for a second week of gains as investors flock to the safe haven amid tariff uncertainties and expectations that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates again.

China's stock benchmark closed at its highest since mid-December amid growing optimism for more Beijing policy support and a rising appetite for Chinese names from global investors.
Shanghai's CSI 300 jumped 2.4% as investors dived into consumer stocks. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng China Enterprises index (^HSCE) in Hong Kong finished with a 2.7% gain.
China's authorities are seen as poised to bring in policies to boost consumer spending and confidence, after the financial regulator laid out plans to encourage banks to offer loans.
But Beijing appears to be struggling to find ways to meet its spending targets, even as Elon Musk-led DOGE in the US shoots for $1 trillion in spending cuts. The risk of economic damage from President Trump's tariff hikes also looms large.
At the same time, recession worries sparked by that trade war are driving global investors to take cover in an unusual haven, Chinese stocks, analysts suggest. The stocks are trading 30% under their 2021 highs, while the 17% gain for Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) since Trump's election far outshines the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 9% drop
Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer writes in today's Morning Brief:
Tesla (TSLA) shares moved up 1.7% in premarket trading, clawing back a chunk of Thursday's 3% loss after a report that the EV maker is planning a lower-cost Model Y for China.
The smaller version of Tesla's best-selling model will cost at least 20% less to manufacture, Reuters reported.
The plan is a bid to regain market share in China, where Tesla has lost a lot of ground. Its shares have dropped over 30% in the past month as sales slid in Europe, too, and amid dismay at CEO Elon Musk's role on President Trump's team. The stock has erased all its post-election gains.
Meanwhile, Trump's tariff policy is causing concern at Tesla, which has signaled it's worried that an escalating tit-for-tat trade war will ramp up its manufacturing costs.

How comedian Mo Welch came back from financial rock bottom,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-comedian-mo-welch-came-back-from-financial-rock-bottom-175748557.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Listen and subscribe to Living Not So Fabulously on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
The gig economy has become the primary source of income for many workers in the United States — especially those in creative fields.
But for the roughly 59 million US workers who classify as independent workers, gig work can lead to financial insecurity.
That was the case for comedian and cartoonist Mo Welch, who admitted to being ""so bad at money managing"" early in her career. On a recent episode of Living Not So Fabulously, Welch shared how she frequently felt like she was ""masking"" her financial situation to appear more put together around her peers.
""A lot of it was just being extremely poor for a very long time — which did lead to a lot of great jokes,"" Welch said (see video above or listen below). ""But it's a lot of jokes that I'm happy to retire because they were also sad.""
After moving to Los Angeles with a car full of wigs and other costume supplies, Welch admitted that even with the support of various odd jobs, paying for the classes and experiences she needed to further her career in comedy remained daunting.
""I actually had this girlfriend who was good at her finances and had a trust fund, and she was like, 'Well, basically, you're bad at finances and you're a comedian ... so you never know when your next check is coming,'"" Welch recounted. The girlfriend then suggested Welch attend a Debtors Anonymous meeting, where she could meet others who were also freelancers and struggling with their money.

Welch said it wasn't until she accepted that she needed help that she felt she could stop ""pretending"" to have her situation in order.
""I had to put like a lot of pride aside and put that shame away and be like, OK, I actually do need help with this because I was not taught how to manage a dollar,"" she said, noting that it made her repeatedly question her success in her career. ""The financial shame was always like rock bottom.""

As Welch built a community of freelancers, she eventually learned how much independent workers can write off on their taxes and how to find the right accountant to help her find those tax breaks.
""Unfortunately, with comedy, you're waiting for something to happen,"" Welch said. ""It's not necessarily that I got my shit together. For me, in comedy, it did take a decade to make any money.""
Welch's big break didn't come until she drew the first iteration of ""Blair,"" the deadpan cartoon she started while visiting her mom during a particularly low point in her career.
""That is what led me to, like, my first big paycheck in Hollywood, which was getting a book deal and being able to sell that as a TV script and working with Chelsea Handler to produce ['Blair'],"" she shared. ""And that's when things really started rolling — once I really leaned into my rock bottom and was honest with myself and said, 'Hey, wake up. You need to make a change here.'""

Cybersecurity firm Rubrik CEO: 'We see continued strong demand',https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cybersecurity-firm-rubrik-ceo-we-see-continued-strong-demand-171611801.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Count Rubrik (RBRK) as another software play not seeing a slowdown in business at the hands of March's market volatility.
""We see continued strong demand,"" Rubrik co-founder and CEO Bipul Sinha told me on Yahoo Finance on Friday. Sinha's comments echo those of Docusign CEO Allan Thygesen to Yahoo Finance earlier this morning.
Sinha added, ""We are confident in delivering on our full-year goals.""
Shares of the cybersecurity firm priced its April 2024 IPO at $32, above the high end of their expected range. The stock opened for trading at $38.60.
The upsized IPO hauled in $752 million for Rubrik's expansion plans, initially valuing the company at $5.6 billion.
The stock now trades at $69, and the company sports a market cap of $13 billion after a 25% post-earnings pop today.
Rubrik's fourth quarter showed a cybersecurity play getting a larger chunk of spend from tech departments seeking to protect data in the age of AI. The company grew sales at a hearty pace and cut its losses significantly versus the prior year.
""Overall, this was another massive quarter for the Rubrik growth story, which we believe is still in the early innings with the market for cyber resilience estimated to hit $53 billion by 2027,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.
Ives reiterated an Outperform rating on the stock.
Fourth quarter net sales: +47% year over year to $258.1 million vs. estimates for $233 million

Americans sour on economy as inflation expectations hit highest level since 1991,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/americans-sour-on-economy-as-inflation-expectations-hit-highest-level-since-1991-145631578.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Consumer sentiment tumbled in March as the impacts of President Donald Trump's tariff policies and elevated price increases remain top concerns for Americans.
The latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey released Friday showed sentiment hit its lowest level since November 2022. The index slid to a reading of 57.9, below the 64.7 seen last month and the 63 expected by economists.
Pessimism over the inflation outlook soared again in March as one year-inflation expectations jumped to 4.9% from 4.3% the month prior. Just two months ago, consumers had only expected inflation of 3.3% over the next year.
Long-run inflation expectations, which track expectations over the next five to 10 years, climbed, too, hitting 3.9% in March, up from 3.4% in February. This marks the highest level of long-term inflation expectations since 1991. Also in the release, the expected change in unemployment hit its lowest level since the Great Financial Crisis.
""While current economic conditions were little changed, expectations for the future deteriorated across multiple facets of the economy, including personal finances, labor markets, inflation, business conditions, and stock markets,"" University of Michigan Survey of Consumers director Joanne Hsu said in the release. ""Many consumers cited the high level of uncertainty around policy and other economic factors.""
Hsu added that frequent gyrations in economic policies make it ""very difficult"" for consumers to plan for the future and therefore weigh on sentiment. The recent tumble in consumer sentiment has come as the new Trump administration has slapped tariffs on imports from multiple countries but frequently flip-flopped on what the actual tariff rates will be and when they'll be implemented. The European Union and Canada have now also threatened retaliatory tariffs on the United States.
The tariff back-and-forth largely hasn't hit incoming inflation data yet. Earlier this week, a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that its ""core"" Producer Price Index (PPI) — which tracks the price changes companies see and excludes food and energy — rose 3.4% from the year prior, down from the 3.6% seen in January. The day before, the bureau's Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed core prices rose 3.1% in February, the lowest yearly increase in core CPI since April 2021.
Capital Economics assistant economist Harry Chambers noted that given recent data, the increase in inflation expectations seen in Friday's survey was ""entirely consumers’ increasing concerns about the impact of tariffs.""
""The plunge in the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index in March, paired with the surge in inflation expectations, indicates that consumers’ concerns about the impact of the Trump administration’s policies are growing,"" Chambers wrote.
The survey's release comes one day after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) officially entered correction, falling more than 10% from its Feb. 19 all-time high. Wall Street strategists have recently noted that the uncertainty around Trump's policies has been a key driver of the recent sell-off.
Guggenheim Partners Investment Management CIO Anne Walsh told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday that the ""the on, then off, then on and then off again narrative"" surrounding tariffs is driving volatility in the market. And as long as that persists, there likely isn't a direct path higher for stocks.
""It doesn't feel like a smooth trajectory [for stocks] because of all of the noise,"" Walsh said.

"Gold reaches $3,000 as trade war escalates, economic uncertainty rises",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gold-reaches-3000-as-trade-war-escalates-economic-uncertainty-rises-140658775.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Gold made the sprint to $3,000 on Friday as uncertainties about the economy and an escalating trade war drove up demand for the safe-haven asset.
Gold (GC=F) futures rose to hover above $3,008 per ounce while spot gold reached above $3,001.
The precious metal was on track for a second straight week of gains amid new data indicating moderating inflation and the announcement of retaliatory tariffs from the United States' trading partners.
""Though it feels like a psychological threshold, gold at $3,000 might just be a stepping stone if trade wars deepen,"" said Tony Redondo, founder of Cosmos Currency Exchange. ""That said, it’s not all about Trump. Central banks, interest rate bets, geopolitical tensions, and inflation concerns are all stoking the flames.""

Trade tensions grew this week after President Trump threatened 200% tariffs on wine and spirit imports from Europe on Thursday. The threat followed the EU's announcement of retaliatory tariffs after the US put a 25% duty on steel and aluminum.
Gold is up more than 12% year to date after making multiple record highs in recent months.
""All eyes are on how gold continues to play a role as a safe haven asset,"" said Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council. ""With rising inflation expectations, lower rates, and continued uncertainty, we continue to see support for gold looking ahead.”
Wall Street has been playing catch-up by raising price targets to keep pace with gold's rise.
In a note on Thursday, Macquarie Group predicted the precious metal will touch $3,500 in the third quarter.
""Year-to-date, gold has been running ahead of our expectations,"" wrote Marcus Garvey, head of commodities strategy at Macquarie.
""We are raising our gold price forecast to a 3Q25 quarter average peak of $3,150 per ounce and our single point price high to $3,500 per ounce,"" he added.
Wall Street strategists have attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared.
Institutional investors have shipped elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York in a move to front-run tariffs and take advantage of a price disparity between London and New York.

Sen. Ted Cruz on Trump tariffs: I don't want to see big tariffs long-term on Mexico and Canada,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sen-ted-cruz-on-trump-tariffs-i-dont-want-to-see-big-tariffs-long-term-on-mexico-and-canada-131242950.html,"Oops, something went wrong

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz supports President Trump's use of tariffs, just not for the long term.
""I fully support the president using the threat of tariffs to incentivize Mexico and Canada to help secure the border. Now that being said, my home state of Texas does an enormous amount of trade with Mexico and Canada. I don't want to see the long-term economic policy being big tariffs against Mexico and Canada,"" Cruz told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).
""And so my hope is that those policies stay as an incentive rather than an ongoing feature of economic policy.""
The president has paused 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican imports that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA). But Trump on Wednesday hit Canada with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, backing off a floated 50% duty.
On Thursday, Trump said that if the European Union didn't remove a 50% tariff on whiskey, the US would place a 200% tariff on wine, champagne, and other alcoholic products.

China unveiled a 15% tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton products and an additional 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. The new tariffs from China began on Monday.
Canada announced a 25% tariff on 30 billion Canadian dollars of US imports.
As for Cruz, there is a lot at risk for his home state of Texas after brisk 3.9% GDP growth in 2024.
Mexico has been Texas's biggest trade partner for the past 16 years. Texas's top imports from Mexico include electric machinery, sound and TV equipment, various fuels, and medical and surgical equipment.
Texas houses about one-third of US refining capacity and refines crude oil imported from Canada and Mexico.
Businesses in the state may already be wary of the tariff pinch.
The latest Dallas Fed survey for February saw its production index — a barometer of state manufacturing conditions — plunge 21 points from January. The new orders index fell 11 points and the capacity utilization index declined 14 points.
Perceptions of broader business conditions worsened in February too.
""It's clear in the next four years, we will see more tariffs than we had the previous four years,"" Cruz said. ""What I've urged him [the president] is two things. No. 1, focus on China. I have said for a long time that China poses the greatest geopolitical risk to the United States over the next hundred years. And so I want to see our economy delink from China.""
""And then secondly, what I've urged the president to do is focus on reciprocity,"" he explained. ""And the virtue of reciprocity is if President Trump imposes tariffs on a foreign country and the foreign country doesn't like those tariffs, they already have a solution to that, which is lower the tariffs they're putting on US goods.""

Investors have reacted harshly this month to the flurry of tariff headlines.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.4% on Thursday, the 10th daily decline this year with a loss above 1% according to data from Creative Planning chief markets strategist Charlie Bilello. Last year, at this point, the S&P 500 had only three big down days, which Bilello said was ""abnormally"" low.
The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are each down by about 5% in March.
Some of the market's often most popular stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR), have seen pullbacks of more than 10% from their 52-week highs.
Wall Street recession calls have begun to creep into the picture too.
""Well, look, there's no doubt there has been some uncertainty,"" Cruz said. ""When I talk to business leaders, the most consistent question I get from them is what's going to happen on the tariff front? So I understand that uncertainty, and I think it'll take some time to have a clearer picture of what the exact tariff landscape is going to look like.""

Trump and Powell are playing from the same strategy book: Morning Brief,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-and-powell-are-playing-from-the-same-strategy-book-morning-brief-100005093.html,"Oops, something went wrong

The chart of the day
What we're watching
What we're reading
Economic data releases and earnings
The stock market is used to the wait-and-see approach from the Fed. But now the president is riffing on that game plan too.
Their deliveries contrast sharply. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is explicit. We can wait and are in a position to do so. And as the outlook evolves and the tariff landscape takes shape, the central bank can take action with its powder dry.
Trump is opaque. When a sympathetic business journalist recently asked him to offer clarity to the market, he scoffed. The stock market's tanking? So what. Another day, another tariff. But the similarities between the two leaders come in the form of detachment from Wall Street panic and a longer-term view.
Trump isn't exactly known for his patience. But on the issue of levies, he's been both unyielding in thought and transactional in practice. Mexico and Canada received some reprieve, but Europe is under new threats. And the dizzying back-and-forth has created a conceptual traffic jam of economic paralysis that has reverberated through consumer sentiment.
Trump is daring heads of state to respond, Powell is waiting for Trump to make up his mind and data to change, and Wall Street is looking for the White House and the Fed to get off the fence.
If Trump's distinctive tariff policy is a time bomb, the explosion of them taking effect isn't the only dangerous part. It's the ticking, the randomness of the timer, the affliction caused by the endless anticipation. Businesses may dislike tariffs. But what they really hate is uncertainty.
Meanwhile, the Fed has to make sense of fluctuating pricing pressures.
On Thursday, new inflation data showed price increases slowed in February — but economists saw warning signs that the central bank may interpret as reasons to continue waiting.

""Thursday's inflation data is backward looking, and the real worry is the inflationary effects that may come from tariffs, which is a wildcard for markets and the Federal Reserve,"" said Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management. ""It's too early to tell what tariffs mean for inflation because we don't know yet the extent of the tariffs or if the administration will end up reversing course and adopting a more dovish tariff policy.""
But if tariff clarity is delayed indefinitely, it's hard to imagine rate cuts not sharing that itinerary.
The waiting game has other ripple effects. As this newsletter has discussed this week, Wall Street is struggling to calibrate the timing of Trump's pronouncements with their potential longer-term consequences. What triggers a stock market sell-off today might actually boost corporate profits later this year. That's a favorable way of viewing Trump's America First strategy.
“If the Fed makes monetary policy decisions based on policies enacted today, they could make substantial cuts to interest rates in 2025,"" said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. ""On the other hand, if they assume that the overall fiscal stance will be more supportive of growth after factoring in decisions likely to be made later in the year, they may reduce rates only a little, if at all, in 2025.""
Investors are used to the Fed's approach — and its straightforward dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. But they are still coming to grips with Trump's agenda. And as hard as it is to accept the sequencing of pain first and pleasure later, it's still not a guarantee.
So far, the only sure thing is discomfort for today and uncertainty for tomorrow.

"Dollar General, Dollar Tree stocks rise as penny-pinching consumers look for low-cost options",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-general-dollar-tree-stocks-rise-as-penny-pinching-consumers-look-for-low-cost-options-214803835.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Bargain-hunting shoppers are boosting the fortunes of dollar-store chain Dollar General (DG).
On Thursday before market open, Dollar General beat the Street's lowly estimates across the board as it posted higher-than-expected earnings, revenue, and same-store sales growth.
""The results came in a little bit better than we had expected but also kind of exhibited that environment is still pretty tough,"" Morningstar analyst Noah Rohr told Yahoo Finance over the phone, ""Management cited continued pressure from low-income customers.""
Read more: What Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet
Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos told investors on a call that the company is ""not anticipating improvement in the macro environment, particularly for our core customer.""
Roughly 60% of Dollar General sales come from a household with an income of less than $35,000.
Vasos added, ""In turn, we know our customers expect value and convenience more than ever.""
For 2025, the company expects net sales to grow 3.4% to 4.4% and same-store sales to increase 1.2% to 2.2%. EPS is expected to come in between $5.10 and $5.80.
Shares of Dollar General jumped 7% during Thursday's trading session. Rival Dollar Tree also clocked a 7% gain.
Here's what Dollar General reported for its fiscal fourth quarter results, compared to expectations:
Adjusted earnings per share: $1.68, versus $1.50
Revenue: $10.30 billion versus $10.25 billion
Same-store sales: 1.2%, versus 0.9%
Dollar Tree is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter results on March 26 before market open.
Wall Street expects Dollar Tree to post revenue of $8.27 billion, alongside adjusted earnings of $2.21 and same-store growth of 1.5%. The company is also in the midst of a transition. On March 5, it announced Stewart Glendinning will replace current CFO Jeff Davis, who is leaving effective March 30.
In a note to clients, Telsey Advisory Group Joe Feldman said this could ""result in modifications to the business strategy.""
He added that ""there are still several moving parts that cloud our visibility on 2025 and beyond."" That includes the fate of the company's struggling Family Dollar business, its multi-price concept, as well as the ""ongoing need to invest in the business"" with aspects like ""remodels and labor.""
UBS analyst Michael Lasser called it a ""very uncertain"" backdrop for the consumer, which makes Dollar General ""appealing"" since it offers essentials like grocery items.
CEO Todd Vasos said its consumers have been ""negatively impacted by ongoing inflation,"" causing their financial situation to worsen over the past year. Its customers ""only have enough money for basic essentials with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities,"" he said.
Middle- and higher-income shoppers are also looking to save as their wallets get pinched.
""What has really become apparent leaving the fourth quarter and moving into the first quarter is the trade-down is back, both [from] the mid- and upper-end,"" Vasos told investors.
As tariffs take effect, that trend could continue.
The ""lower-end consumer has been struggling,"" S&P Global Ratings retail director Matt Todd told Yahoo Finance. Should uncertainty continue and tariffs ""send us into more of an economic slowdown,"" he expects ""trade down [among consumers] to accelerate.""
The impact of tariffs might be something even high-income consumers can't take on, S&P Global Ratings' Bea Chiem told Yahoo Finance. ""There's a lot of signs that are pointing to a softer environment, and they really can't absorb much more inflation.""
Spending cuts and tariffs could further complicate the picture, as dollar store chains have limited room to hike prices and have shoppers who depend on government programs. Overall, direct imports make up 41% to 43% of Dollar Tree's total retail value purchases, and China supplies the majority of those imports, per a company filing.
Dollar General's exposure to tariffs is much lower, as 80% of its sales are food items, most of which are nonperishable items made in the US, like canned soups, beans, and chips, Rohr said.
He added that the company only imports about 4% of its cost of sales, which likely comes predominantly from China.
""We believe we are well positioned to mitigate the impact in 2025. We were able to successfully mitigate the tariff impact in 2018 and 2019, though we did take retail price increases in some instances along with others across the industry,"" Vasos said on the earnings call.

Canadian grocery stores are sidelining US products — and American businesses are feeling the pinch,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-grocery-stores-sidelining-us-233240945.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Canadian customers are telling US businesses they will stop buying US products.
Grocery chains in Canada are sidelining American products and expecting their sales to drop.
The boycott, in addition to retaliatory tariffs, could have an impact on the US agricultural industry.
Canadian businesses large and small have been turning down American products, starting with non-essentials like alcohol, and spreading toward a wider variety of food products that economic experts say could hit different levels of the agriculture supply chain.
""Basically, overnight, everything changed, maybe irreparably,"" said Alisa Gorokhova, a resident of Quebec, as she recalled the morning after the tariff announcements came for the first time. ""There's suddenly 'made in Canada' labels on things and American booze is gone from the shelves.""
Gorokhova said she now sees shoppers actively checking where everything is made, taking the task of boycotting US products seriously.
The increasing animosity Canadians are showing toward American products comes after Trump repeatedly imposed and paused a 25% tariff on Canadian exports, and most recently slapped a 25% tax on Canadian steel and aluminum. Trump also talks often about his desire to make Canada the 51st state of the US and called Justin Trudeau, Canada's now-former prime minister, the ""governor.""
As a result, American businesses are feeling the pinch. Ethan Frisch, CEO and founder of Burlap & Barrel, a public benefit corporation based in New York that specializes in fairly sourced single origin spices, said that he has been receiving emails from Canadian customers he had a long relationship with saying they will no longer purchase his products because of the boycott.
""We're not really sure how to handle this,"" said Frisch. ""We as individuals at Burlap & Barrel did not vote to put Trump in office and we do import some spices from Canada as well, so our supply chain is very intertwined with the whole tariff situation.""
""All this could force us to buy less from our partners by introducing an extra level of risk, which really contradicts our mission of putting more money into the pockets of smaller farmers,"" he added.
Large grocery chains across Canada are also spotlighting local products in response to patriotic sentiments.
Take Sobeys Inc., Canada's second-largest national food retailer with approximately 1,600 stores across ten provinces. A spokesperson of its parent company, Empire Company Limited, told Business Insider that over the past year, around 12% of their sales came from products sourced in the US, but given their work to ""find alternatives to US sources over the past 30 days, that number is expected to decrease.""
Metro Inc. with around 1,000 grocery stores in Quebec, Ontario, and New Brunswick, as well as Longo's, a family-owned grocery chain mainly operating across the Greater Toronto Area, both said they have rolled out an in-store program to label individual products with more salient Canadian identification. Local products are also being promoted on their websites and newsletters.
The latest available data from the International Trade Administration shows that Canada is still the largest destination for US exports of high-value agricultural products.
Economic and policy experts have told Business Insider that depending on the size of the target and the length of the boycott, the agriculture sector in the US could suffer, especially under the current push to cut back on federal spending.
""This is going to hurt the industries here, there's no doubt about it,"" said Larry Gerston, professor of public policy civic engagement at San Jose State University. ""Whether it will hurt more than a counter tariff, that depends on if they can focus on a targeted set of products, how serious they are about it, and how much the Canadian government supports the boycott.""
""As I see it, the Canadians are a very proud people, and they are very offended this time,"" said Gerston.
Trump's current tariff on China and the expected counter-tariffs could also intensify the pain on top of boycotts by Canadians.
Jerry Nickelsburg, professor of economics at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, said that farmers received government subsidies during Trump's first term when they suffered from retaliatory tariffs from China, but they ""should not expect that they'll receive a subsidy this time"" under the new directive to cut government spending.
""We can expect that demands for US agriculture products would decline not only from Canada, but also from China,"" said Nickelsburg. ""And if you have soft demand, that means this is going to impact both the price and farmers' income.""

"A list of companies that have pulled back on DEI, including Salesforce, Amazon, Google, and Meta",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-harley-davidson-john-deere-104339285.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Companies have pulled back or ended DEI programs amid pressure from conservative activists and a new administration.
Those that have withdrawn or toned down DEI initiatives include Google, Amazon, and McDonald's.
President Donald Trump has moved to end DEI initiatives at federal agencies shortly after taking office in January.
The number of companies ending their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs continues to grow.
Salesforce, Google, and consulting giant Deloitte are some of the most recent examples, joining companies including Meta and Amazon in announcing the rollback of DEI initiatives.
In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to end diversity programs across the federal government and ordered all federal DEI staffers be placed on leave while their departments are disbanded.
The move away from DEI policies is part of an ongoing wave of backlash against diversity programs at American companies.
Tech companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Zoom cut DEI programs last year, and law firms, including Winston & Strawn, faced lawsuits for affirmative action.
Some DEI initiatives have faced backlash from conservatives and activist groups, including mounting social media campaigns, many led by Robby Starbuck. Starbuck, a prominent conservative activist with a sizable social media following, has argued that these initiatives don't align with the values of companies' largely conservative consumer bases.
That said, 59% of Americans oppose Trump's move to end federal efforts to promote the hiring of women and members of racial minority groups, according to a Reuters-Ipsos poll in January. Some companies, including Costco, have publicly defended their diversity initiatives.
Here are how some companies have changed or eliminated their DEI programs.
Salesforce
In its annual financial disclosures filed on March 5, Salesforce left out language describing diversity and inclusion as core values, a change from past filings. Language about some executive compensation being tied to employee diversity measures was also gone.
The company said in the filing that it's still committed to equality, but it's ""firmly rooted in compliance with federal law and other applicable laws and regulations in the regions in which we operate.""
""We value the equality of every individual at our company and in our communities and are dedicated to fostering a workplace that complies with these protections, creating an inclusive culture where every individual feels seen, heard and valued,"" Salesforce said in its filing.
Salesforce's CEO Marc Benioff has previously shown support for LGBTQ+ employees, and spoken out about an Indiana bill that made it legal for individuals to use religious beliefs as a defense when sued by LGBTQ+ people. In an interview with Axios earlier this year, the CEO said the company would do ""everything"" possible to help employees if someone was targeting them.
Deloitte
Deloitte, the world's largest professional services firm, has scrapped some DEI programs and asked staff working in its Government & Public Services division to remove pronouns from their email signatures.
The decision to change DEI policies followed ""a detailed review of all pertinent government directives to ensure we comply with their requirements, both as a private enterprise and as a government contractor,"" Doug Beaudoin, Deloitte's chief people officer, told employees in an internal memo seen by BI.
Deloitte receives $3.2 billion annually through its contracts with federal agencies.
The firm's UK division has split with its US counterpart on DEI. The week of the changes, Deloitte's UK chief sent a memo to staff confirming that the firm remained ""committed"" to diversity goals in the UK.
KPMG
Fellow Big Four firm KPMG has ended a DEI talent strategy that was set up amid the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests and removed annual DEI transparency reports from its website.
The consultancy's changes were announced via an internal memo sent to the US workforce on February 14.
""The legal landscape surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts has been shifting, via executive orders and in the courts,"" Paul Knopp, chair and CEO of KPMG US, wrote in the memo.
KPMG is ending its ""Accelerate 2025"" strategy, which aimed to achieve 50% of managing partners and managing directors coming from underrepresented backgrounds by 2025. KPMG typically tracks progress to the end of its financial year on September 30.
In September 2023, 45.3% of US partners and managing directors came from under-represented groups such as women, racial minorities, and LGBTQ+ individuals, according to a report still available on KPMG's website.
Amazon
Amazon has changed its DEI language on some of its website pages and discontinued some programs.
The company removed all mentions of diversity and inclusion from its 2024 annual report. As recently as January 24, Amazon's DEI page was titled ""Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion,"" according to an archived page viewed by BI. That page is now called ""Inclusive Experiences and Technology.""
""We update this page from time to time to ensure it reflects updates we've made to various programs and positions,"" an Amazon spokesperson told BI.
In December, Candi Castleberry, Amazon's vice president of inclusive experiences and technology, said in a memo that the company was shutting down several ""outdated"" DEI programs to focus on initiatives with ""proven outcomes,"" Bloomberg reported.
Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec, the vice president of technology at Amazon Web Services, told employees in late January that the company was ""not pulling back on DEI initiatives,"" adding, ""there's no change to the commitment, but we didn't roll it out that well,"" according to a transcript obtained by BI.
Accenture
Global consulting firm Accenture has updated its diversity and inclusion goals, according to an internal memo sent by CEO Julie Sweet in February and seen by BI.
The company is ""sunsetting"" its 2017 employee representation goals and career development programs for people of specific demographic groups.
Accenture will also pause submissions to external diversity benchmarking surveys while it evaluates whether to continue participating in those surveys, the memo said.
Sweet said the changes come as a result of the ""evolving landscape in the United States, including recent Executive Orders with which we must comply,"" as well as the company's continual evaluation of internal policies.
Sweet noted in the memo that Accenture had largely achieved its 2017 representation goals. She also wrote that the company would invest more in core career development programs and ""put a greater focus on inclusion and a sense of belonging for all.""
Google
Google told employees in February that it will no longer have hiring goals tied to representation.
It's also evaluating its DEI programs and initiatives, including ""those that raise risk, or that aren't as impactful as we'd hoped,"" Google's chief people officer, Fiona Cicconi, wrote in a memo to staff.
""We're committed to creating a workplace where all our employees can succeed and have equal opportunities, and over the last year we've been reviewing our programs designed to help us get there,"" a Google spokesperson told BI.
The spokesperson said Google updated language in its annual 10-K report to reflect the change.
""As a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes required following recent court decisions and executive orders on this topic,"" the spokesperson added.
Target
Target sent a memo to its employees in January announcing the end of its three-year DEI goals.
Written by Kiera Fernandez, Target's chief community impact and equity officer, the memo characterized the change as a way to remain ""in step with the evolving external landscape.""
The memo also announced that Target would no longer participate in surveys that monitored diversity within the company, and would end a program to carry more products from minority-owned businesses.
Target will also be changing the name of its ""Supplier Diversity"" team to ""Supplier Engagement.""
Meta
Meta announced it was rolling back many of its DEI initiatives in January.
In an internal memo, the company's vice president of human resources, Janelle Gale, said there would no longer be a team focused on DEI, adding that the term had become charged and that it suggested, to some, ""preferential treatment of some groups over others.""
""The legal and policy landscape surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in the United States is changing,"" she wrote. ""The Supreme Court of the United States has recently made decisions signaling a shift in how courts will approach DEI.""
The changes affect diversity efforts across hiring, choosing suppliers, and training, the memo said.
McDonald's
Fast food giant McDonald's joined the ranks of large American companies rolling back some DEI initiatives.
The company announced in a press release on January 6 that it would stop setting representation goals, pause participating in external surveys related to DEI, and end a requirement for supply chain partners to adhere to DEI targets.
McDonald's diversity team will also get a new name. It'll be called the ""Global Inclusion Team"" instead, the company said in its January announcement.
Despite these changes, McDonald's says inclusion remains one of its ""core values.""
Representatives of McDonald's did not respond to a request for comment from BI sent outside regular working hours.
Harley-Davidson
In August, Harley-Davidson said on X that it would drop diversity-based spending goals from suppliers, halt socially motivated employee training, and withdraw from an annual LGBTQ acceptance rating by the Human Rights Campaign, Bloomberg reported.
Harley told Bloomberg that the company was ""saddened by the negativity on social media over the last few weeks, designed to divide the Harley-Davidson community,"" following Starbuck's calls on X for the company to apologize and change its policies.
Bloem, from the Human Rights Campaign, said in the statement to BI that retreating from DEI hurts employees and customers.
""Harley-Davidson's choice to back away from the Corporate Equality Index is an impulsive decision fueled by fringe right-wing actors and MAGA extremists who believe they can bully their way into dismantling initiatives that help everyone thrive in the workplace,"" Bloem wrote.
John Deere
John Deere has pulled back on its DEI commitments, including no longer participating in cultural awareness events and abolishing the company's pronoun policy, BI reported in July.
While John Deere did not publicly announce the reason for its decision, the shift came following online criticism from Starbuck in a video from X, which garnered over 5 million views in July.
Tractor Supply Company
Tractor Supply significantly scaled back its DEI programs, including eliminating diversity roles and withdrawing from Pride event sponsorship. The company also announced that it would no longer provide data to the Human Rights Campaign, and it would end its carbon emission goals. This came after Starbuck's criticized the company for promoting what he labeled as ""woke"" policies, NPR reported in June.
Polaris
While Starbuck did not specifically target Polaris, the Harley competitor has reduced its DEI efforts, including removing any mention of the term from its web pages. In a statement to Bloomberg, the company emphasized its intention to abstain from political discussion.
Lowe's
Home improvement retailer Lowe's said that it would scale back its DEI programs in an internal note viewed by Bloomberg.
Per the memo, the company will stop participating in surveys run by the Human Rights Campaign, and it will merge resource groups for minority employees into one umbrella organization, Bloomberg reported on August 27.
Starbuck said on X that he caused Lowe's policy shift. However, a Lowe's spokesperson told Bloomberg that they had already begun making changes prior to Starbuck's involvement.
Lowe's has a consumer base largely consisting of rural baby boomers, according to data from the consumer analytics firm Numerator.. The company was labeled ""best place to work for LGBTQ equality"" by the Human Rights Campaign in Lowe's 2021 culture, diversity, and inclusion report.
Orlando Gonzales, the senior vice president of programs of research and training at the Human Rights Campaign, told BI in a statement that scaling back from DEI policies would have negative consequences for companies in the long run.
""Companies should not cower to a random guy with zero business experience,"" Gonzales said, citing Starbuck's removal from the Tennessee GOP ballot in 2022.
Ford
In an internal email shared with Bloomberg by Starbuck, the carmaker said that it would pull out of certain diversity rankings, such as the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index.
The company also said that it would reorient its employee resource groups to make them accessible to all staff. Ford also pledged to be less involved in political matters and changed some corporate sponsorships.
Ford faced backlash after it saw quality issues and vehicle recalls.
Starbuck wrote in a post on X that Ford's withdrawal from DEI initiatives came just as he was investigating Ford's ""woke policies.""
Meanwhile, the HRC said that Ford ""cowered"" to Starbuck and that the company had ""decades of commitment to inclusion and top ratings on the HRC Corporate Equality Index.""
""The Human Rights Campaign could not be more disappointed to see the company shirking its responsibility to its employees, consumers, and shareholders,"" said HRC president Kelley Robinson in a statement.
Molson Coors
Beverage company Molson Coors is scrapping many of its DEI policies and initiatives, CNBC reported in September.
In an internal memo obtained by BI, Molson Coors said it would remove quotas for supplier diversity. These quotas, which encourage sourcing supplies from minority or women-owned businesses, can be ""complicated and influenced by factors outside"" the company's control.
Additionally, the brewer stated that it will shift company training away from DEI-based programs to focus more on key business objectives.
The company said the decision to scale back, which was in the works since March, was made to ensure that executive compensation is solely based on business performance and does not include ""aspirational representation goals,"" according to the memo.
Molson Coors will also no longer participate in the HRC Equality Index or any other third-party company rankings, reported CNBC. The company has previously received a perfect 100-point score for 19 consecutive years.
The memo added that the driving force behind the change was ""the understanding that when all our people know they are welcome, they are more engaged, motivated, and committed to our company's collective success.""
Survey results published by the HRC in September found that more than 75% of adults from the LGBTQ+ community unfavorably view companies that rolled back DEI initiatives.
The HRC's Gonzales said that the LGBTQ+ community holds over $1.4 trillion in spending power in the US and wants to ""work for and support companies who support us.""
The companies did not respond to BI's requests for comment.
Walmart
Walmart will end some of its DEI initiatives, including winding down its nonprofit Center for Racial Equity, which Walmart funded with $100 million in 2020 for five years, and discontinuing programs that assist minority-owned suppliers.
The company will also stop using the phrase DEI in company documents, stop sharing the details of its LGBTQ+ corporate policies with the Human Rights Campaign and stop allowing third-party sellers to list items marketed toward the LGBTQ+ community.
""We are willing to change alongside our associates and customers who represent all of America. We've been on a journey and know we aren't perfect,"" Walmart said in a statement to BI.
In a post on the social media platform X, conservative activist Robby Starbuck claimed credit for Walmart's policy change, calling it ""the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America.""
Nissan
Nissan is rolling back some of its diversity initiatives, Starbuck announced on social media in December.
In a statement provided to BI when asked about Starbuck's post, Nissan said, ""Whether with employees, customers, business partners, or the communities we serve, we believe that Nissan is a company for everyone. For nearly four decades, our commitment to respect and inclusion has been rooted in our values, shaped an environment where each of our team members can contribute at work, and ultimately contributed to the success of our business.""
Starbuck said when he reached out to Nissan about their ""woke policies"" the company was receptive. He shared a letter that he said was sent to Nissan employees from company exec Jeremie Papin.
The letter said the company would stop participating in third-party surveys with organizations ""heavily focused on political activism."" Starbuck said that meant the company would not participate in the Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group.
The letter also said the company would align employee training with ""core business objectives"" that support ""personal job performance and career advancement.""
Nissan told BI it was already working on its communications with employees due to questions received internally but acknowledged it had also spoken with Starbuck ahead of the announcement.
Goldman Sachs
Goldman Sachs significantly reduced language referencing DEI in its annual report.
The bank's 2024 annual report referred to diversity in the context of human capital a total of three times, down significantly from the 14 times it was mentioned in the 2023 report and the 16 times it cropped up in 2022.
The company also eliminated a category from the report titled ""Diversity and Inclusion,"" which used to feature diverse hiring goals and a hiring breakdown by race and gender.
Goldman's ""aspirational hiring goals"" also expire this year, and the bank hasn't yet disclosed whether they'll set new ones.
Earlier this year, Goldman also ditched a policy that required IPO clients to have a minimum of two diverse board members. The change came after a December court ruling over a similar policy at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
The investment bank first implemented a board diversity initiative in 2020, which mandated that IPO clients must have at least one diverse board member. A year later, Goldman raised the requirement to two members and stipulated that one must be a woman.
Goldman initiated a legal review of its policy after the December court decision, according to a company spokesperson.
""As a result of legal developments related to board diversity requirements, we ended our formal board diversity policy,"" said Goldman spokesman Tony Fratto. ""We continue to believe that successful boards benefit from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and we will encourage them to take this approach.""
Disney
Disney told employees in a memo that it's refocusing its DEI efforts to business goals and company values. The changes will also affect content advisory notices that Disney started adding to movies in 2020, BI previously confirmed.
The memo, which BI has verified, said that DEI will be less important in determining executive compensation and that Disney is ditching Reimagine Tomorrow, a digital hub it launched to focus on underrepresented voices.
Disney also said in the memo that its Business Employee Resource Groups will rebrand as Belonging Employee Resource Groups.
The company is no stranger to political controversy over social issues. CEO Bob Iger has criticized Trump in the past, but taken a more muted approach in the beginning of his second term.
Citigroup
Citigroup's CEO Jane Fraser sent a memo to staff in late February saying that the bank would rename its diversity, equity, and inclusion team to ""talent management and engagement.""
The bank will also get rid of ""aspirational representation goals except as required by local law,"" the memo said. It continued that job candidates and interview panels don't need to be diverse anymore.
Warner Bros. Discovery
Warner Bros. Discovery is putting an end to its participation in third-party workplace surveys, according to a memo obtained by Business Insider.
The company will ""continue to gather internal data that allows us to understand how our employee base reflects the audience we serve.""
The memo was signed by Jennifer Remling and Asif Sadiq, WBD's Chief People and Culture Officer and Chief Inclusion Officer.
It also detailed the adoption of a ""uniform and consistent application process"" across all WBD's ""talent programs, including internships, mentoring, and other development programs.""
The company will retain its business resource groups, the memo said, and continue to ""prioritize inclusive storytelling"" and grow ""an inclusive team.""
The company's overall work in the DEI space will now be referred to as ""inclusion."" The memo also stated that WBD would be correspondingly ""updating the language"" used on its website, as well as throughout its internal channels.
Kohl's
On March 14, The department store chain Kohl's changed the title of its chief DEI officer to chief inclusion and belonging officer.
Bloomberg first reported the change, noting that the retail giant had removed all references to DEI on its website, instead replacing the phrase with the words ""inclusion and belonging.""
""We have evolved our framework to focus on inclusion and belonging,"" Michelle Banks, who has held the role since it was created in 2021, said, Reuters reported.
Banks, who has been with the company since 2010, told Reuters that Kohl's also broadened its supplier diversity program, adding qualified small businesses, including diverse small businesses.
Representatives for Kohl's did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Elon Musk's SpaceX asks US to address foreign trade barriers,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musks-spacex-asks-us-225247555.html,"Oops, something went wrong
(Reuters) - SpaceX has urged the U.S. to address trade barriers affecting its Starlink satellite communications service in foreign countries, arguing that competitors from abroad face no import costs in the country.
The Elon Musk-owned company said that it has to pay foreign governments for access to spectrum, import duties on Starlink equipment and other regulatory fees, which ""artificially"" inflate operating costs abroad.
Starlink operates in more than 120 markets worldwide, though in some countries, SpaceX must coordinate spectrum sharing with domestic satellite operators before activating service.
The company described the requirements as a ""protectionist non-tariff trade barrier,"" in a letter to the U.S. Trade Representative's Office dated Tuesday.
""These anti-competitive policies have been used by foreign operators to block or slow SpaceX from providing a better quality and lower cost service to customers in those countries,"" Matt Dunn, SpaceX's senior director for global government affairs said in the letter.
SpaceX's concerns come amid broader tensions involving trade barriers for American companies.
U.S. automaker Tesla, which is also led by Musk, warned on Friday that it and other major American exporters are exposed to retaliatory tariffs stemming from aggressive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on goods from countries like Canada, China, and the EU.
Musk is a close ally of Trump and has been leading the White House effort to shrink the size of the federal government. The billionaire heads the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.

"Berkshire Hathaway director Olson to step down, Buffett opposes shareholder proposals",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-hathaway-director-olson-step-224844933.html,"Oops, something went wrong
By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway said on Friday longtime Director Ronald Olson will be leaving its board because of a policy change requiring directors, except for Warren Buffett, to step down after turning 80.
In a proxy statement for its May 3 annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, Berkshire also said its board unanimously urged the rejection of seven shareholder proposals, including three on its subsidiaries' diversity and anti-discrimination efforts.
Berkshire also said Buffett's compensation was $405,111 in 2024, comprising his usual $100,000 salary plus personal and home security.
Vice Chairman Greg Abel, who is expected to succeed Buffett as chief executive, and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain saw their compensation grow $1 million to $21 million each.
Abel, 62, oversees non-insurance businesses such as the BNSF railroad and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, while Jain, 73, oversees insurance businesses such as Geico car insurance.
Olson, 83, is a partner at the law firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, and has been a Berkshire director since 1997.
He is leaving Berkshire's 14-member board because of the new age limit in its corporate governance guidelines. All other directors apart from Buffett are 75 or younger.
Olson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Buffett is excused from the age limit because he controls 30.3% of Berkshire's voting power, triggering an exception for people who control at least 5%.
The 94-year-old billionaire also owns about 14.4% of Berkshire stock. He would be allowed to remain a director upon retiring, if the independent directors want him to stay.
Shareholder proposals include resolutions by conservative investors that Berkshire report on how its business practices affect employees based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin and political views, and on risks from its subsidiaries' race-based initiatives.
Berkshire's board called both reports unnecessary, saying subsidiaries set their own policies and ""Berkshire's approach is simple - follow the law and do the right thing.""
The board also opposed a proposal to create a committee to oversee diversity and inclusion, saying its audit committee already oversees diversity matters.
It also said a proposal to have independent directors oversee risks associated with artificial intelligence was unnecessary and inconsistent with Berkshire's decentralized culture.

Vance hopeful 'high-level' TikTok deal will be completed by early April,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vance-hopeful-high-level-tiktok-223128062.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Vice President JD Vance said Friday that he was hopeful a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. will be wrapped up by the early April deadline.
“There will almost certainly be a high-level agreement that I think satisfies our national security concerns, allows there to be a distinct American TikTok enterprise,” Vance said in an interview with NBC News abroad Air Force Two.
Questions about the future of the popular video sharing app have continued to linger since a law requiring its China-based parent company to divest or face a ban took effect on Jan. 19. After taking office, President Donald Trump gave TikTok a 75-day reprieve by signing an executive order that delayed enforcement of the statute until April 5.
Vance, along with National Security Adviser Michael Waltz, were tapped by Trump to find an approved buyer. On Sunday, Trump told reporters aboad Air Force One the administration was in talks with “four different groups” about TikTok and that a deal could come soon.
TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, have not publicly commented on the talks. It’s also unclear if ByteDance has changed its position on selling TikTok, which it said early last year it does not plan to do.
After it made those comments, ByteDance and TikTok launched a legal challenge against the federal law, which was passed with bipartisan support in Congress and signed by then-President Joe Biden. In January, the two companies lost their case at the U.S. Supreme Court.
NBC News reported that Vance did not offer details on who the potential buyers could be but noted that some issues could push a final agreement past the April 5 deadline.
“We’d like to get it done without the extension,” Vance told the news outlet. “I think the question is, what is the equity ownership of the new joint venture? How do you do the contracts for all the investors, the customers, the service providers? … The deal itself will be very clear, but actually creating those thousands and thousands of pages of legal documents, that’s the one thing that I worry could slip.”
Trump has previously said the deadline on a TikTok deal could be extended further if needed. He has also proposed terms in which the U.S. would have a 50% stake in a joint venture. The administration hasn’t provided details on what that type of deal would entail.

How Intel Became the S&P 500’s Top Performer This Week,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-became-p-500-top-222952489.html,"Oops, something went wrong
picture alliance / Getty Images

Intel's stock was the S&P 500's top performer this week after the chipmaker named a new CEO.
The company announced Wednesday that veteran semiconductor executive Lip-Bu Tan will be its new CEO, effective March 18.
The appointment also follows speculation about deal talks, with Reuters reporting TSMC approached other chip firms about forming a joint venture to run Intel's foundry.

Intel's (INTC) stock was the S&P 500's top performer this week after the chipmaker named a new CEO amid speculation about the future of its foundry business.
The company announced Wednesday that Lip-Bu Tan, the former CEO of semiconductor software firm Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), will become its new CEO as of next Tuesday, sending shares soaring. They've added close to 17% this week, at $24.05 as of Friday's close.
Deutsche Bank analysts called the move a ""desirable outcome"" for Intel, highlighting Tan's ""extensive expertise in the semiconductor ecosystem.""
Bank of America analysts suggested Tan could usher in a strategic shift for the company’s foundry business, which has been the subject of acquisition rumors for months. Earlier in the week, Reuters reported Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) approached other chip firms Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) about forming a joint venture to own and run the U.S. chipmaker's foundry division.
The foundry has also been viewed as a potential beneficiary of the Trump administration's stated goal of ensuring artificial intelligence chips are designed and manufactured in the U.S. The Reuters report said Trump asked TSMC for help in turning around Intel.
With this week's gains, Intel's stock is up 20% in 2025, making it the best-performing chip stock on the S&P 500 for the year so far. That’s a stark change from 2024, which saw the chipmaker's stock lose more than half of its value.

What is the Amex trifecta? How to get more value from your Membership Rewards Points.,https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/credit-cards/article/amex-trifecta-222344046.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Some advertisements and offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure.
If you’re a fan of the American Express Membership Rewards program, you probably already know how valuable Amex points can be. A great Amex rewards card can offer plenty of annual savings for any budget.
But if you really want to upgrade your rewards value — especially if you’re a frequent traveler with regular travel spending — you can use a specific trio of Amex cards to get the most from every dollar you spend.
The Amex trifecta is made up of three American Express rewards cards:
The Platinum Card® from American Express
American Express® Gold Card
The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express
Together, these cards can offer even more dynamic savings on future travel, everyday spending, and more.
Here’s more about the three cards that make up the Amex trifecta:
Why we like it: The Platinum Card from Amex is one of the most premium rewards cards available today. Its only bonus categories are focused on travel, and you’ll get the best value if you’re willing to book through Amex Travel, the issuer’s travel portal.
But the best feature of the Platinum Card is its benefits — specifically if you’re a frequent traveler. Amex says the Platinum Card offers over $1,500 in annual value with credits for hotel stays, airline fees, digital subscriptions, and much more. You’ll also get access to more than 1,400 airport lounges across the world (including Centurion Lounges) through Amex’s Global Lounge Collection.
Read our full review of the Platinum Card from American Express.
Why we like it: On its own, the Amex Gold offers incredible savings on everyday purchases, with an unbeatable 4x points at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets (up to limits). It also offers hundreds of dollars in value on purchases you can make at home or on the go, including dining and rideshare credits. In fact, the Amex Gold card is one of our best travel card picks from any issuer.
As part of this Amex trifecta, it’s a great tool to supplement the Amex Platinum’s travel rewards and still earn plenty of points when you’re not traveling. If you’re able to max out the $25,000 annual spending cap for earning 4x at U.S. supermarkets, for example, you’d net 100,000 Membership Rewards Points each year — at a value of 1 cent per point, that could get you up to $1,000 in travel redemptions.
Read our full American Express Gold Card review.
Why we like it: The Amex Blue Business Plus Credit Card is the only business card in the trifecta, so you will need a business to qualify. You could be eligible whether you do freelance work, have a side gig, or you’re a brick-and-mortar small business owner. It’s a pretty straightforward no-annual-fee credit card (see rates & fees) on its own, with a solid 2x points on every purchase up to the first $50,000 annually, then 1x points. Beyond rewards, there are a few added benefits.
But if you’re considering the Amex trifecta, the Blue Business Plus card adds a lot of flexibility. You can use this card for all of your non-bonus spending and get 2x points on each purchase until you meet the annual limit. If you max out the $50,000 spending cap, you could earn a total of 100,000 Membership Rewards Points with the card each year.
Read our full review of the Blue Business Plus Credit Card from American Express.
With the right strategy, you can make the most of each dollar you spend using the Amex trifecta.
One of the main benefits of using the trifecta is the ability to get top rewards rates across a range of categories — so you’ll have more Amex Membership Rewards to redeem when you’re ready to book a trip.
First, start with the Amex Platinum for your travel spending:
5x points on flights booked directly with airlines or AmexTravel.com (up to $500,000 per year), then 1x
5x points on eligible prepaid hotels booked through AmexTravel.com
If you spend beyond the $500,000 max on eligible flights in a calendar year with your Amex Platinum, you can still use your Amex Gold to earn an unlimited 3x points on flights booked directly with airlines or through AmexTravel.com. The Amex Gold card can cover some additional travel methods, too:
3x points on other eligible travel (prepaid car rentals, prepaid cruise reservations) booked through AmexTravel.com with Amex Gold
Beyond travel, look to Amex Gold for the best rewards on groceries and dining out:
4x points at restaurants worldwide (up to $50,000 spent per year), then 1x
4x points at U.S. supermarkets (up to $25,000 spent per year), then 1x
For all other expenses, you’ll get bonus points with the Blue Business Plus card at its flat rewards rate:
2x points on all other purchases (up to $50,000 spent per year), then 1x
This includes all of your regular purchases that don’t fall into the above bonus categories — gas or EV charging, utility payments, tourist attractions, event and concert tickets, online shopping, and more — up to the annual limit. If you have a large budget, it can also include spending across otherwise eligible bonus categories after you max out those annual spending caps.
The other major component of the Amex trifecta that makes it worthwhile for travelers is all the added benefits* and annual credits.
Most of your annual perks will come from the Amex Platinum card — especially for travel. This card is loaded with everything from airport lounge access to airline fee credits, credits for airport security programs (like TSA PreCheck and Clear), and more. Plus, you’ll get automatic elite status with a few partner travel brands: Marriott Bonvoy Gold Elite Status; Hilton Honors Gold Status; and premium status with Avis, Hertz, and National car rental companies.
You’ll get some travel benefits with the Amex Gold card, too. But like its rewards, this card’s most valuable perks are on food spending. You can get over $300 in annual value just from various Amex Gold dining credits:
Up to $84 in statement credits ($7 per month, with enrollment) at U.S. Dunkin’ locations
Up to $100 in statement credits ($50 semi-annually, with enrollment) when you dine at U.S. Resy restaurants or make other eligible purchases with Resy
Up to $120 in statement credits ($10 per month, with enrollment) at participating dining partners including Grubhub, The Cheesecake Factory, Goldbelly, Wine.com, and Five Guys
Another major benefit of both cards is annual Uber Cash** for food delivery or rideshares. Here’s the breakdown of the combined $320 you can use toward Uber spending each year with both the Amex Platinum and Amex Gold:
Up to $200 Uber Cash ($15 per month and a bonus $20 in December) with the Amex Platinum
Up to $120 Uber Cash ($10 per month) with Amex Gold
*Terms apply for each of these American Express card benefits; many also require enrollment. Make sure you check your card’s terms and your online account for specific benefit offers.**To receive this benefit you must have downloaded the latest version of the Uber app and your eligible American Express Platinum Card or American Express Gold Card must be selected as the payment method. The Amex benefit may only be used in the United States.
You can get a lot of potential value with the Amex trifecta, but it will take some effort to figure out where and how to make each purchase.
For example, many of these cards’ top reward categories have annual spending caps; after you meet these maximums, you’ll earn just 1x point per dollar in the category. If you’re a big annual spender (or even think you could get close to a category’s spending max), it’s important to track when you’re approaching the cap.
Benefits also require some strategizing. These card perks are incredibly valuable, but they can also be difficult to keep up with. Some renew each month, some are semi-annual, and some reset once per calendar year. Ensure you track your benefits on your own or within the Amex app regularly.
Always remember to keep your card statements and monthly payments organized, too. The quickest way to lose reward value is by accruing interest charges on a card balance. Know your due dates and track your spending so you can pay on time and in full each month to avoid interest and fees.
Related: A complete list of credit card perks that reset every year
These cards can save you a lot of money on travel and other expenses, but they also come at a cost:
The Platinum Card has a $695 annual fee (see rates & fees), the Amex Gold has a $325 annual fee (see rates & fees), and the Blue Business Plus (see rates & fees) has no annual fee. Altogether, that’s $1,020 in annual fees for the three cards.
No matter your budget, spending over $1,000 in annual fees is a high price to pay. If you travel often and spend a lot of money in the eligible rewards categories, it is possible to make up that cost. Just make sure you compare your own potential value based on your spending before you apply.
Related: Are credit cards with annual fees worth it?
Great welcome offers: Each of these cards offers valuable welcome bonuses for new cardholders. Make sure you time your applications so you can both meet the spending thresholds within the given time periods (without overspending) and minimize any effects on your credit score.
Valuable points: With the Amex trifecta, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to maximize the points you earn when spending across multiple categories. When it’s time to redeem your rewards, you can choose between multiple options within the Membership Rewards program, including booking flights through AmexTravel.com or transferring points to Amex’s airline and hotel transfer partners.

High annual fees: The annual fees you’ll pay for the Amex trifecta are pricey. While you may be able to easily recoup that cost through rewards and benefits, you’ll still pay a lot of money each year to keep these cards. Make sure you look at how you spend and travel before you apply to ensure this card strategy is right for you.
Other card combinations may work better for you: The Amex trifecta isn’t the only option for combining rewards cards to maximize your earnings. If these reward categories and benefits don’t align with how you already like to travel and where you spend money, another card combination may work better for your financial goals.
Related: How to harness the power of the Chase trifecta
The Amex trifecta can be a great solution for fans of American Express Membership Rewards. You can use the different reward categories and benefits to maximize your points and save money at home and abroad.
But first, decide whether this card strategy fits with how you already travel. If you don’t use the services included in the cards’ annual benefits or you prefer to book travel outside of the eligible bonus categories, you may not get the best value with these cards.
Also, remember that one of the cards in this trifecta is a business card, which may not work for you if you cannot qualify.
Instead of the Blue Business Plus, you could keep your trifecta to all consumer cards and choose the American Express® Green Card. This card isn’t quite the catch-all you’ll get with the Blue Business Plus, but you can diversify your rewards a bit with 3x points on transit (including trains, rideshares, tolls, parking, buses, and more) as well as an additional annual credit for Clear Plus membership (up to $199 in statement credits, subject to auto-renewal).
Before you apply for any new rewards card — or decide to use a card combination like the Amex trifecta — always look back at your regular spending habits and redemptions. With the right cards for your budget, spending, and travel preferences, you can ensure you make the most of your rewards now and in the future.

Republican Congressman Jim Jordan asks Big Tech if Biden tried to censor AI,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republican-congressman-jim-jordan-asks-221209706.html,"Oops, something went wrong
On Thursday, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) sent letters to 16 American technology firms, including Google and OpenAI, asking for past communications with the Biden administration that might suggest the former president ""coerced or colluded"" with companies to ""censor lawful speech"" in AI products.
The Trump administration's top technology advisors previously signaled they would pick a fight with Big Tech over ""AI censorship,"" which is seemingly the next phase in the culture war between conservatives and Silicon Valley. Jordan previously led an investigation into whether the Biden administration and Big Tech colluded to silence conservative voices on social media platforms. Now, he's turning his attention to AI companies — and their intermediaries.
In letters to technology executives including Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, Jordan pointed to a report his committee published in December that he claims ""uncovered the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to control AI to suppress speech.""
In this latest inquiry, Jordan asked Adobe, Alphabet, Amazon, Anthropic, Apple, Cohere, IBM, Inflection, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Salesforce, Scale AI, and Stability AI for information. They have until March 27 to provide it.
TechCrunch reached out to the companies for comment. Most didn't immediately respond. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Stability AI declined to comment.
There's one notable omission in Jordan's list: billionaire Elon Musk's frontier AI lab, xAI. That may be because Musk, a close Trump ally, is a tech leader who has been at the forefront of conversations about AI censorship.
The writing was on the wall that conservative lawmakers would ramp up scrutiny over alleged AI censorship. Perhaps in anticipation of an investigation such as Jordan's, several tech companies have changed the ways their AI chatbots handle politically sensitive queries.
Earlier this year, OpenAI announced it was changing the way it trains AI models to represent more perspectives and ensure ChatGPT wasn't censoring certain viewpoints. OpenAI denies this was an attempt to appease the Trump administration, but rather an effort to double down on the company's core values.
Anthropic, for its part, has said that its newest AI model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, will refuse to answer fewer questions and give more nuanced responses on controversial subjects.
Other companies have been slower to change how their AI models treat political subject matter. Leading up to the 2024 U.S. election, Google said that its Gemini chatbot wouldn't respond to political queries. Even well after the election, TechCrunch found that the chatbot wouldn't consistently answer even simple questions related to politics, like ""Who is the current President?""
Some tech execs, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have added fuel to conservative accusations of Silicon Valley censorship by claiming the Biden administration pressured social media companies to suppress certain content like COVID-19 misinformation.

Drugmakers agree to participate in second round of price negotiations,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drugmakers-agree-participate-second-round-220842483.html,"Oops, something went wrong
(Reuters) -All drug manufacturers, including Novo Nordisk and Teva Pharmaceuticals, whose medicines are part of the second round of price talks have agreed to participate in the negotiation process, a federal health agency said on Friday.
The price negotiation process was established under former President Joe Biden's signature Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
The second cycle of negotiations will take place under President Donald Trump's administration. The U.S. government has said that it plans to aim for ""greater transparency"" in Medicare drug price negotiations under Trump, following criticism from the pharmaceutical industry for the Biden-era law.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said on Friday that the negotiations ""will include robust engagement with drug companies and the public.""
The agency will send an initial offer for each drug with its maximum fair price proposal no later than June 1, and the drugmakers will have 30 days to either accept it or provide a counteroffer.
CMS plans to invite a drugmaker for up to two additional negotiation meetings during the summer and fall before the period ends on November 1, in case an agreement is not reached after the initial meeting.
Novo Nordisk's diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss treatment Wegovy are among the 15 drugs targeted for the price negotiations for 2027.
Other drugs on the list include Pfizer's cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi, Teva's Huntington's disease treatment Austedo, and AbbVie's bowel syndrome drug Linzess.

(Reuters) - VanEck filed for an exchange-traded fund on Friday that will track the price of Avalanche's avax coin, as asset managers seek to capitalize on the growing interest in cryptocurrencies beyond bitcoin.
Investment firms are increasingly rolling out new products aimed at investors who are looking for the next breakout token, following bitcoin's remarkable rally.
Earlier this month, Franklin Templeton filed for an ETF tied to the spot price of cryptocurrency XRP. In February, the asset manager had also filed for an ETF that will track the spot price of Solana.
Avalanche's avax coin has a market capitalization of about $8 billion, according to cryptocurrency data and analysis firm CoinGecko.

"Poilievre Takes Shot at Carney’s Record, Saying He Failed at Bank of England",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/poilievre-takes-shot-carney-record-212752965.html,"Oops, something went wrong
(Bloomberg) -- Canadian Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Mark Carney should have been fired when he was governor of the Bank of England, arguing that the new Canadian prime minister’s economic record isn’t as strong as he presents it.

Poilievre, speaking to reporters hours after Carney was sworn in as Canada’s new leader, said Carney had acted as an “unreliable boyfriend” while leading the central bank from 2013 to 2020. That’s a reference to a quote from British lawmaker Pat McFadden, who criticized Carney over a decade ago for not following through after signaling plans to hike interest rates.
Poilievre accused Carney of “changing his mind constantly” as Bank of England governor and “printing too much money, which led to inflation.” Annual inflation averaged about 1.6% in the UK while Carney led the bank and he left in March 2020, meaning he didn’t oversee much of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic — after which it surged, peaking above 11% in late 2022.
“Mark Carney should have been fired when he was the head of the Bank of England,” Poilievre said.
The comments illustrate the battle lines for an election campaign that’s likely to start soon and that is almost certain to be focused on which leader is best to manage the economy and handle a trade war with the US. Poilievre, who has been Conservative leader since 2022, built a significant lead in opinion polls by focusing on inflation, housing shortages and other economic issues. That lead has narrowed — and in some surveys it has disappeared altogether — after Justin Trudeau resigned and Carney won a vote to replace him.
Carney spokesperson Audrey Champoux said Poilievre was “desperate to misrepresent” Carney’s economic experience “because he has none of his own.”
Carney guided Canada as its central banker through the 2008 financial crisis, “protecting jobs and helping ensure that Canada came out stronger,” she said. “He was then recruited to lead the Bank of England, and stewarded the United Kingdom’s economy through Brexit and the economic and political crises that followed.”
Poilievre made the comments after being asked whether he plans to fire Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem if the Conservatives win the next election. Poilievre made that pledge in 2022, but hasn’t repeated it in recent years.
While he didn’t mention Macklem by name in his response, he offered no support for the country’s top monetary policymaker. He spoke generally about civil servants’ responsibilities, in addition to slamming Carney.
“I believe that government officials should be accountable for their decisions and when they fail government officials should be fired. That is how life works in the real world and that is how life will work when I am prime minister of Canada,” he said.
Poilievre has previously criticized the Canadian central bank for its first-ever foray into quantitative easing starting in 2020, saying it contributed to inflation. When he was the Conservative finance critic, he accused the Bank of Canada of acting as “an ATM” for Trudeau’s spending by purchasing government bonds, which suppressed interest rates and made it cheaper for the government to borrow.
Before joining the Bank of England, Carney served as governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013. Macklem sat on the governing council while Carney was in charge, before becoming governor in 2020.
This week, Macklem said the central bank “needs to stay clear of any comments that could be seen as political in nature,” when he was asked about Carney’s recent victory as Liberal leader.
George Osborne, the former UK Conservative chancellor of the exchequer who hired Carney to lead the Bank of England, told the Canadian Broacasting Corp. on Friday that he was “so thrilled he said yes, and Britain was better off for it.”

Meta Is The Only Magnificent 7 Stock In The Green In 2025—Watch These Key Levels,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-only-magnificent-7-stock-215348385.html,"Oops, something went wrong

Meta Platforms shares jumped on Friday amid a broader market rally, after logging their biggest one-day drop since July the previous session.
Meta is the only member of the Magnificent Seven group of mega-cap technology stocks to be in positive territory so far this year.
Investors should watch major support levels on Meta's chart around $535 and $460, while also monitoring crucial resistance levels near $635 and $740.

Meta Platforms (META) shares jumped on Friday amid a broader market rally, after logging their biggest one-day drop since July the previous session.
The social media giant's stock has come under pressure over the past month as the broader market has tumbled, with Big Tech stocks suffering outsize losses amid concerns about lofty valuations and slowing growth. Meta shares are down 18% from their record high set in mid-February.
However, Meta is the only member of the Magnificent Seven group of mega-cap technology stocks that remains in positive territory for 2025. The stock is up nearly 4% since the start of the year, while each of the other Mag 7 stocks is down at least 8%.
Below, we break down the technicals on Meta’s chart and identify major price levels worth watching out for amid the possibility for further price swings.
Meta shares staged a decisive breakdown below an ascending channel on Monday before the price retested the pattern’s lower trendline in Wednesday’s trading session. Bears used the bounce as an opportunity to accelerate selling yesterday, before today's recovery.
Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) confirms weak price momentum with a reading near its August lows, though looming oversold conditions may trigger short-term recovery rallies in the stock.
Let’s use technical analysis to locate major support and resistance levels that investors may be monitoring.
Meta shares rose 3% on Friday to close at $607.60, after falling nearly 5% yesterday.
The first overhead level to monitor is $635, an area that provides a confluence of resistance from the ascending channel’s lower trendline that sits alongside peaks which formed on the chart in December and January.
A convincing close above this level may see bulls make another run at the $740 level, a location on the chart where Meta shares would likely attract significant attention near their all-time high (ATH).
The first support level to watch sits around $535. The shares could find buying interest in this area near a multi-month trendline that connects three prominent peaks on the chart between April and August last year.
Selling below this important technical level could see the stock revisit lower support at the $460 level. Investors who favor buy-and-hold strategies may look for entry points in this region near the low of a consolidation period that followed last year’s February breakaway gap, a location that also roughly aligns with the July and August troughs.

The package includes a salary of $1 million, plus a 200% performance-based bonus, the chipmaker said in a filing Friday. It also includes $66 million in long-term equity awards and stock options and new-hire incentives.
Separately, Tan agreed to buy $25 million in Intel shares in the first 30 days of taking the job. “Lip-Bu’s purchase reflects his belief in Intel and commitment to creating shareholder value,” the company said in a statement.
Earlier this week, Intel announced Tan was filling the role left vacant when the board ousted his predecessor, Pat Gelsinger. The semiconductor industry veteran, who previously served as an Intel board member, is tasked with trying to return the company to the forefront of an industry that it dominated for decades.
Tan, 65, will assume the role on March 18, the company said Wednesday. He will rejoin the board as well after stepping down in August 2024.
Intel’s stock has rallied this year, gaining 20%, including a surge of 15% on Thursday following the announcement of Tan’s appointment.

Tesla raises concerns over retaliatory tariffs in unsigned letter,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-raises-concerns-over-retaliatory-214500562.html,"Oops, something went wrong
Elon Musk's electric vehicle company Tesla has joined several other American businesses in raising concerns over retaliatory tariffs that could result from a trade war fueled by President Trump.
In an unsigned letter on Tesla letterhead addressed to the U.S. trade representative, Tesla warned that Trump's actions to ""address unfair trade practices"" could ""inadvertently harm U.S. companies.""
Read more: 'I've been betrayed.' Tesla drivers are pushing back on Elon Musk
Trump imposed a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico in an effort to alleviate the ""threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs,"" according to a White House fact sheet. The tariffs have triggered a trade war that threatens to raise the cost of a number of consumer goods.
Earlier this month, a trade group representing nearly all major automakers except Tesla said the tariffs on Canada and Mexico could lead to drastic price hikes and supply chain disruptions, Reuters reported.
Tesla's letter, posted on the U.S. trade representative's website, said that past U.S. tariff actions have led to increased costs for domestic manufacturing and increased tariffs on EVs exported to foreign countries.
""U.S. exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to U.S. trade actions,"" the letter from Tesla said. ""Tesla encourages USTR to consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions.""
A representative of Austin, Texas-based Tesla could not be immediately reached for comment.
Tesla's message to the U.S. trade representative is notable because the company's chief executive, Musk, is a close Trump ally and is leading efforts to downsize the federal government. In a show of support for Musk and Tesla this week, Trump purchased a new red Model S in an event on the White House lawn.
Tesla's stock, which has plummeted 34% since January, received a boost after Trump's vehicle purchase and was up nearly 4% at the end of the day Friday, closing at $249.98.
The letter comes as some Tesla owners are protesting Musk's political actions by selling their vehicles or adding anti-Musk bumper stickers to their rides.
Some politicians and celebrities, including Sen. Mark Kelly, a Democrat from Arizona, have publicly shared plans to get rid of their Tesla vehicles.

Tesla facilities in the United States support more than 70,000 employees and are responsible for billions of dollars of economic activity each year, the letter said. The company has multiple manufacturing sites in California, including an assembly plant in Fremont and a ""megafactory"" in Lathrop.
Tesla's letter also warned of supply chain issues that could result from existing and proposed trade policies.
""Even with aggressive localization of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the United States,"" the letter said. ""Trade actions should not [and need not] conflict with objectives to further increase and support domestic manufacturing.""
The trade group Autos Drive America, which represents foreign automakers, including Toyota and BMW, warned the U.S. Trade Representative in separate comments that imposing broad-based tariffs would disrupt production at U.S. plants and lead to higher prices for consumers.

AI coding assistant Cursor reportedly tells a 'vibe coder' to write his own damn code,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-coding-assistant-cursor-reportedly-214457509.html,"Oops, something went wrong
As businesses race to replace humans with AI ""agents,"" coding assistant Cursor may have given us a peek at the attitude bots could bring to work, too.
Cursor reportedly told a user going by the name ""janswist"" that he should write the code himself instead of relying on Cursor to do it for him.
“I cannot generate code for you, as that would be completing your work ... you should develop the logic yourself. This ensures you understand the system and can maintain it properly,"" janswist said Cursor told him after he spent an hour ""vibe"" coding with the tool.
So janswist filed a bug report on the company's product forum: “Cursor told me I should learn coding instead of asking it to generate it,” and included a screen shot. The bug report soon went viral on Hacker News, and was covered by Ars Technica.
Janswist speculated that he hit some kind of hard limit at 750-800 lines of code, although other users replied that Cursor will write more code than that for them. One commenter suggested that janswist should have used Cursor's “agent” integration, which works for bigger coding projects. Anysphere, maker of Cursor, couldn't be reached for comment.
But Cursor's refusal also sounded an awful lot like the replies newbie coders could get when asking questions on programming forum Stack Overflow, folks on Hacker News pointed out.
The suggestion is that if Cursor trained on that site it may have learned not just coding tips, but human snark as well.
